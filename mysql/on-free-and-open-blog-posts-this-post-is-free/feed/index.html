					<description><![CDATA[@Giuseppe,

Thanks a lot!
Regarding you two additional points: Ouch! I fail them both!
Will update my theme...

@Bjorn,
Askimet is not foolproof. I do manual moderation on comments and get a lot of spam even with Askimet turned on.
May I suggest reading Baron Schwartz&#039; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/10/11/three-steps-to-stopping-blog-comment-spam/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2007/05/28/my-unorthodox-captcha-blocked-thousands-of-spam-comments-every-week/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed. If you do want comments on your blog, please let anyone participate without registration. 

I&#039;d say AKISMET is the best way to fight spam, very effective and user-friendly. Its a simple web service which tells if a comment is spam or not based on some rules and (I think) an internal database. It&#039;s part of wordpress but you can also use it standalone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi,
Thanks for your feedback.
While we don&#039;t have powers on the openness of comments, we can indeed check on the openness of contents. 
Most of the problems with open contents come from wrong feeds, which happen because a feed was changed and not properly checked after submission. So what can appear at first sight evil to the readers is often just a simple mistake.
I have done some controlled censorship(*) by removing the offending feeds and told the authors to submit a better one.
Hopefully, this will result in better satisfaction for Planet MySQL readers.

If I may add my own list to your Cahiers de doléances, I have two of my own:
* No indication of what format is accepted (HTML? which tags? CR conversion?) so I am often shooting in the dark when commenting.
* No preview for comments, which, paired with the previous item, leads to some embarrassing posts.

Cheers

Giuseppe

(*) Hey! it&#039;s a joke! We don&#039;t do censorship]]></description>
