					<description><![CDATA[Heh.

My vacation this year, our youngest daughter was still waking up and screaming several times a night. She would sit up in her bed, and my job (since I had no job to wake up to in the morning) was to go there and put her back to sleep.

Half asleep, I diligently kept count whether I should fail her over to the left side of the bed, or the right side. Later in the morning I became anxious because I couldn&#039;t remember which turn it was. I then woke up enough to realize she is not a MySQL master-master pair undergoing failover tests, and I can put her to sleep either way :-)

The week before I had written a new Pacemaker MySQL agent.]]></description>
