					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jacky,

As per the FAQ: https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator/wiki/FAQ
the answer is no. Please read through to learn about supported replication features.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi,

Can this work with 3rd party MySQL replication like Continuent?

Thanks,

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Arjen,

GTID is workable, whether MySQL 5.6 or MariaDB 10.0; since, other than the need for orchestrator to recognize which MySQL/MariaDB version this is, and whether it supports GTID, or whether the slave is confiured to have GTID (and all of the above are simple to find out), there is little trouble in actually using GTID (which is I guess the whole point).

So this would actually simplify some steps such as move-up and move-below.

Given that I&#039;m primarily developing orchestrator at Outbrain, top priority is Outbrain&#039;s technology stack. We are not using MariaDB 10 and do not use GTID. I&#039;m working on several other projects (unrelated to MySQL) so the real problem is of course allocating the time for this. We do have plenty more features we&#039;d like to see in orchestrator that apply to our stack.

So the above is just to be completely open about how things go and are expected to go.

Of course, I&#039;m open for pull requests!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting Shlomi!

Have you looked at MariaDB&#039;s GTID implementation, as it differs a bit from stock MySQL (for the reasons you mentioned). I&#039;d be interested to hear if you find that implementation workable. If you do, then it&#039;d be cool to see it supported in Orchestrator!]]></description>
