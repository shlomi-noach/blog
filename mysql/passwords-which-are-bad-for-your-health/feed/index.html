					<description><![CDATA[shlomi ,
You are SPOT ON!
Great Post! Thanks a lot for sharing a nice article on password, i had gone through the article really very nice and detailed review. To be secured its better to change the passwords very often.
By the way These are some of suggestions when choosing the passwords:
I know that coming up with a good password can be difficult, so here are some guidelines to use.
    * Choose a password that is at least six characters long. This should be long enough to discourage a brute-force attack. Currently, the maximum password length on many Unix systems is eight characters, but if you want to add a few more characters to make it easier to remember, go ahead. Just bear in mind that anything after the eighth character will be ignored (so ``abnormalbrain&#039;&#039; is the same as ``abnormal&#039;&#039;).
    * In general, a good password will have a mix of lower- and upper-case characters, numbers, and punctuation marks, and should be at least 6 characters long. Unfortunately, passwords like this are often hard to remember and result in people writing them down. Do not write your passwords down! 

By the way for more information on Professional Training and Certification for Security courses check this link: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eccouncil.org/certification.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt; http://www.eccouncil.org/certification.aspx&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
