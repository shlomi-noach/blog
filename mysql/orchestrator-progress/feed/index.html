					<description><![CDATA[@Dave,
OK, got it. There&#039;s the underlying mechanism to do that, but it&#039;s not nicely wrapped.
Let&#039;s move this discussion to where it belong. Can you please open an issue on https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator/issues ?

Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@shlomi,

Sorry, let me try again.

MHA has a:

   masterha_master_switch --master_state=alive
   
Along with all of the external hooks. Maybe I missed it, but I was not able to find a method for live master switch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Dave,
I&#039;m not entirely sure I understand your question. Recovery of a failed master works well (and requires pluging into your framework to make the DNS/Zk/Whatever change).

What do you mean by &quot;promoting a replica as master from a live and healthy current master&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting us know that development will continue. Are there anythings about have orchestrator be a replacement for MHA? Recovery of a failed masters appears to be working well, what about promoting a replica as master from a live and health current master?]]></description>
