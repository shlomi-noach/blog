					<description><![CDATA[So &quot;which-should-i-be-using&quot; that part is not addressed or did I miss it?

Moreover, I find the difference to be more vague since, as of MySQL 5.6.5, both TIMESTAMP and DATETIME columns can be automatically initialized and updated to the current date and time.

Also, normally when people talk about timezone being changed, are they referring to timezone of server itself (why would that happen?) or its replica located in different timezone or are they talking about end-user sitting in some other timezone and viewing the data (how should that matter as MySQL is not considering that while storing/retrieval)?

I did a little research and it seems that best practice would be to set all your severs in UTC timezone and use TIMESTAMP datatype for dates. Of course, year 2038 limit of TIMESTAMP is a concern but hopefully we will fix it well in time :) 

What are your thoughts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are other major differences between TIMESTAMP and DATETIME, 

1. TIMESTAMP columns can be told to be updated on INSERTs and UPDATEs, without providing a value for these columns, that is particularly useful in logging.
2. TIMESTAMP columns are converted back and forth between UTC and the session timezones, when the value is inserted/updated in the TIMESTAMP column its converted to UTC, and when the value is retrieved its converted to your session timezone]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Ziv,
But then you lose timestamp information; or are you always using UTC?
Another thing: using the DB&#039;s timestamps ensures consistency. For example, imagine two machines not in sync with global time, which have time offset between themselves.
Also, as a more common scenario. machines that do not always correctly update with the latest Summer Saving time info (especially true for Israel, where the date is not constant and must be updated each year).]]></description>

@Chris
&#062;&#062; MySQL&#039;s magic auto-update-on-modification behavior has led me to avoid timestamp

agreed. very true.
