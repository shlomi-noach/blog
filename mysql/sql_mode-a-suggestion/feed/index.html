					<description><![CDATA[&quot;May I offer my suggestion, then, that future MySQL installations come with a strict sql_mode. &quot; 

On windows, they do. The typical Next/Next/Finish installation procedure leaves you with this setting:

# Set the SQL mode to strict
sql-mode=&quot;STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION&quot;

STRICT_TRANS_TABLES is &quot;a strict sql_mode&quot;. If you do the &quot;Detailed Configuration&quot; procedure you are prompted for it, and you can *uncheck* strict mode (it is on by default and explicitly disrecommended to disable it, see: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/3187938357_257ec2bdc3_o.png)

What always blew my mind is how different things are on Linux. That said I can&#039;t say it has posed much of a problem to me because once you update your configuration to reflect your preferences, you keep on reusing that for subsequent installations.

regards,
