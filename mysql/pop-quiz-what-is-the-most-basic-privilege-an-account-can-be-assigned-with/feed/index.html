					<description><![CDATA[So... for 1) I think it&#039;s just part of query evaluation, and about the same time when detection for an attempted cartesian join. My guess is it&#039;s getting row estimate from engine and then multiplying out and going &quot;whooooo - huge!&quot;.

2) you have to use the explicit CROSS JOIN syntax. http://www.linuxjedi.co.uk/?p=89]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@stewart:
In situation #1, would Drizzle actually start to execute the query in order to find the number of joined rows exceeds the limit? Or is it part of query evaluation that tables are scanned?

In situation #2, I don&#039;t get it. How CAN I perform such query without Drizzle complaining about &quot;Implicit cartesian join attempted&quot;? Seems like the SQL_BIG_SELECTS did not make a change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Sergei,
I&#039;ve had many occasions where a query on INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES/COLUMNS on a busy server brought the server to a complete halt, with dozens of queries locked.
For completeness, I confess this was not done with a user which only had USAGE privilege; your question is fair, and I will try and take courage to test it. I&#039;m afraid this happens mostly on production servers, which I do not really want to bring down.

Whenever I need to make an INFORMATION_SCHEMA query (tables, keys, columns) I prefer to do it on a SLAVE.

So, I will try and complete this; but this will probably not happen today or tomorrow, so please be patient.]]></description>
