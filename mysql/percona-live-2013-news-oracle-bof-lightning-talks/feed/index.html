					<description><![CDATA[In *all* fairness, we still have 2 business conferences for MySQL, and lots of smaller community days. Community gives input and helps plan both conferences, but they&#039;re still business conferences.

					<description><![CDATA[Sheeri,

I also happened to speak to authorities on Oracle, and have a somewhat different understanding than yours of the reasons behind Oracle not participating in Percona Live previously. With apologies I will not elaborate (it&#039;s not that I hold a big secret, just that the talks were private).

But in all fairness, Sheeri, it takes two to tango. I&#039;m not in on the internals of these recent developments. But I&#039;m more than inclined to believe there is an effort on both sides.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be fair, I&#039;m happy for it and it&#039;s a great gain for the community. Sort of. Now we have 2 big business conferences with the same players. Win? I guess because they&#039;re 6 months apart? Most people will only go to one of the 2, though.

I do wish Percona didn&#039;t block having a big community conference. LCA (linux conf australia), Confoo, SCALE in Los Angeles, are all conferences the same size or bigger than the April MySQL Conference that are 100% volunteer run. We could have had that, but Percona blocked it by not participating and doing their own conference instead.

I guess we have what we have....but I give kudos to Oracle for this, not Percona.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From my understanding, Oracle did not want to send engineers to a conference called &quot;Percona Live&quot;. Percona refused to change the name (from my understanding, on the MySQL Council talking directly to Oracle higher-ups, just changing it to &quot;MySQL Conference and Expo&quot; would have been fine, if &quot;Percona&quot; was not part of the title).

Oracle came around, but I don&#039;t see how Percona deserves *any* credit for Oracle deciding to be the grownups.]]></description>
