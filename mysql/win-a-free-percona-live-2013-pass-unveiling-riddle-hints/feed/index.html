The image also comes first on search for  &quot;not entirely subtle hint&quot; and for &quot;not entirely subtle hint common_schema&quot;, so no black voodoo is at hand!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Ben,

&quot;... because the &quot;not entirely subtle&quot; image of the hotel playground comes up as the top image in a google search for &quot;not entirely subtle sandbox hint&quot;  ...&quot;

HA! This is hilarious! Spooky

Will publish the complete answer by tomorrow morning (my timezone); 
Meanwhile, in a couple hours I will publish hint #3, which will remove all doubt about the answer, just so other people can choose to try their hand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to go with MySQL Sandbox, because the &quot;not entirely subtle&quot; image of the hotel playground comes up as the top image in a google search for &quot;not entirely subtle sandbox hint&quot; :-P

I believe Andrew got there with the full explanation first but I&#039;ll go with;
Who will open your present, = I&#039;ll go with present being a loose reference to prompt, and the fact sandbox will &quot;open&quot; with ./use
Make you play pleasant, = lets you test in isolation without affecting anything / anyone else.
Tidy your mess, = sbtool -o delete 
Do the same for all else? = works equally well for all MySQL variants e.g.  MariaDB, Percona Server]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Who will open your present,
Make you play pleasant,
Tidy your mess,
Do the same for all else?

Okay, my initial shot was Query Optimizer but it&#039;s a flawed answer which made me rethink.

I was also thinking that it could be the mysqld, it opens a connection (present == your presence on the server),
makes you play pleasant by parsing your query. If you&#039;re not playing pleasant it will throw syntax errors.
Once parsed it passes your request to the query optimizer and it will &#039;tidy your mess&#039; based on cost weight (explain extended::show warnings),
This is true of all connections. 

But now I&#039;ve seen the hints,
MySQL Sandbox - Will open your present or tar archive and bootstrap an instance,
Can effortlessly create environments for testing technologies such as M&#062;S,MM and Circular replication (makes your play pleasant),
Master controls allows you to &#039;tidy your mess&#039; when you&#039;re finished, take down instances etc.
Does the same for all else...Percona Server, MariaDB, Oracle MySQL. 

Maybe I&#039;m bending this riddle into an answer. 
Maybe there is no spoon.
