					<description><![CDATA[The I_S can indeed be a bit dangerous. I&#039;ve seen a number of installations on which the table_(open_)cache was set to the default and there were were about 4000 tables. To find out the amount of used data inside the ibdata1 file (no innodb_file_per_table) a query against I_S.tables was done and this gave serious issues with the production traffic/queries.

Did you file a bugreport for this issue?]]></description>
