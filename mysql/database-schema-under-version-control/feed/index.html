					<description><![CDATA[For version control, you might be interested in taking a look at the neXtep designer project.

It is a database development environment where you develop on a version control repository. You work on the model, and the system handles all generation of the SQL delta scripts for you. You can synchronize your current developments at any time with a target database of your choice, where you can integrate changes from the database or push developments from the repository.

This is a free opensource GPL product whose aim is to solve many problems related to database version control and developments. We are trying to gather people around the project to get more feedbacks on it.
Tell me what you think.

Here is the link to the project website :
http://www.nextep-softwares.com
And another link of the product&#039;s wiki containing more information on the concepts, tutorials, technical information :
http://www.nextep-softwares.com/wiki

Kind regards,
Christophe]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Peter,

If my memory serves me right, one reason for this was to be certain that auto_increment values would be consistent in a replication setup from the dump (when latest innodb rows are removed, auto_increment remains highest removed row, but that would not reflect in a server built from the dump)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post reminds me that I have always been (almost) angry about that AUTO_INCREMENT =  XXXX information was added to SHOW CREATE TABLE. This makes it harder to get importable structural-only information from a table. It has broken many tools making use of SHOW CREATE.  Integration with version control as described here is another example. Any idea why they did this? Some ugly workaround for a InnoDB slowness issue maybe?]]></description>
