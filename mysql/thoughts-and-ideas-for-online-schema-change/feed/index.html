					<description><![CDATA[@Rudi,

Yes, I was aware they were developing the tool: see discussion on first links you&#039;ve attached.
I wasn&#039;t aware it was out, though. I suspect this will become the preferred tool for this job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, in an age of online application it should be possible to do database schema updates without having to bring your applications offline. This is a wonderful tool by facebook that could be taken further and save many headaches for administrator and developers. 

You would almost expect this to be a function built into mysql workbench! Load a list of SQL DB Schema change statements and run them.

I have looked but do not seem to be able to find any projects related to the live upgrade of mysql schemas. 
Is live updates not a big problem for most HA applications?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Well, allow me to add a few words: the CREATE INDEX is by far not the only thing you can achieve with OSC (although it may be Facebookâ€™s major concern). You should be able to:

    * Add columns
    * Drop columns
    * Convert character sets
    * Modify column types
    * Add partitioning
    * Reorganize partitioning
    * Compress the table
    * Otherwise changing table format
    * Heck, you could even modify the storage engine! (To other transactional engine)

These are giant steps.&quot;

I agree- in 1985 that would have been a big step indeed. Wonderful how well described the crappiness of mysql :
&quot;How easy would it be to write these down into the database? It only takes a few weeks time to work out a working solution with reasonable limitations, just using the resources the MySQL server provides you with&quot;. 
Amen!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe you already no, but if you&#039;re using ndb with MySQL (aka MySQL Cluster) then we have create/drop index, add column, reorganize partition and optimize table online. And by online I mean without table copying and both reads/writes are allowed in parallel.]]></description>
