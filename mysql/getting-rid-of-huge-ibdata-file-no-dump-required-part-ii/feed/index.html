					<description><![CDATA[I agree. To be clear, I have not used the above approach on production. But looking back at past customer use cases, a couple of them could certainly benefit from it.

Thankfully by now there is little to no discussion about InnoDB vs myisam.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Think it&#039;s an interesting approach that you&#039;ve taken to resolve the ibdata file size, but I still the risks and overheads (investigation to see what might break) to achieve it are too high in a real-world environment. More so if the data is that of a financial nature. The safest is to do dump loads, or we can all just keep begging the MySQL developers to make a vacuum function to do background thread cleanup of ibdata files. This size issue of ibdata and idb files and the locking when doing optimizing is honestly one of the biggest flaws in MySQL, if they can fix this issue then MysQL could and would be so much more powerful than it is right now. 

Keep up the blogging, some interesting reading here.
