Be sure to read the comments as there are some improvements / modifications to the original script.

As for those dissing the use of SSH, sometimes there is no choice.  Quite often, we don&#039;t have the luxury of VPN connections because of internal restrictions.  

In those cases, with prudent use of SSH and limiting source IP addresses, you can have a quite secure method of accessing databases from other servers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agree on VPN, whenever possible
I know a sys admin or two who would not open 3306 to anyone, if it cost them their job :)

I suppose the last paragraph makes for an entirely separate discussion, on how best to connect to mysql remotely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Call me old-fashioned, but if you have a significant infrastructure, why not use a VPN? Then all your servers would be able to safely communicate and you can set up grants for private IP addresses that you know attackers can&#039;t use and set up firewalls accordingly.]]></description>
