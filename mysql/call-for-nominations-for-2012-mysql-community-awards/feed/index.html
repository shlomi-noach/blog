					<description><![CDATA[Dear Valerie,

Out of respect to the company you were trying to promote here, I&#039;ve removed the link to their website.
Kindly note the &quot;Kindly include disclosure of relationship with nominee&quot; message in the text.

Apparently you&#039;re an avid &quot;user&quot; of said product, and tend to post &quot;innocent&quot; questions in multiple places about their products.

The thing is, sure, they could be included in one of the categories. But your attempt for SEO is too blunt.

Normally I would delete a comment such as yours altogether; but I decided to answer up front. And commenting like that for this particular post is completely out of place.

I don&#039;t see that you should be using my blog to secretly-aggressively promote your company. I say this as I&#039;ve met with several of its employees on good terms. Kindly refrain from doing so in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi, I was wondering if you know anything about such third-party cloud database services like &lt;del&gt;this one&lt;/del&gt;. If you had something similar, could this be nominated in one of the categories? 

Would appreciate your professional opinion. Thanks!]]></description>
