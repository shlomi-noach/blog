Yes, indeed. Same for &quot;report_host&quot; etc. What I meant, tough, is a generic solution, which would not assume your master&#039;s hostname is &quot;foo&quot; and the slave&#039;s is &quot;bar&quot;. Something that would just say &quot;hey, this is the master because I&#039;m checking up on internal stuff, and right now this is the slave&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Uri,

Yes, FEDERATED engine can be used to query particular tables from other servers. This is not strictly what I meant, tough, as you are limited to those particular tables. But you are right on this.

I should note FEDERATED is nowadays disabled by default (also does not even compile by default) and FEDERATEDX is long anticipated.

With regard to &quot;USE&quot; -- this has nothing to do with connecting to servers. The name &quot;database&quot; is misleading here. &quot;USE&quot; means &quot;change working database (== schema)&quot;, not database server.]]></description>
