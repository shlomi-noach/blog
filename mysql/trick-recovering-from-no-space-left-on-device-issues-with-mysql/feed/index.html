					<description><![CDATA[@Shantanu,
Quoting the above: &quot;I have monitoring, but sometimes I&#039;m hoping to make and operation on 97%-99% utilization.&quot;

Of course you must have monitoring on this. And you might be intersted to get notified when the disk space runs over 95%. But what if I want to push the limits for a specific operation? OK, set it for 99%. Cool. This may still leave me with 6GB I could utilize. I may want to push the limits -- and history shows that sometimes you may just get by at a close margin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Disk full problems vary depending on what type of data it is, and where it is.

Having all data on the root (/) partition is bad, I have had 2 recent experiences where deleting files would not reclaim space (i.e. df stayed at 100% even hours after), the only option was a system restart.

As you say having a dummy file for the @@datadir is a tip I have used in the past.

In my specific post this was a binary log space problem, where this was a dedicate partition.  This could also benefit from the dummy file solution.

MySQL acts very differently depending on if the @@tmpdir, @@datadir or @@log-bin partition locations are full.]]></description>
