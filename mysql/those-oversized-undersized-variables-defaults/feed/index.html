					<description><![CDATA[I agree only to some extent.
Because, in my view, the defaults are really incompatible with the progress.
Why not, then, make group_concat_,max_len be 7? Or innodb_buffer_pool_size be 2K?
Reasonable defaults are important. I mean, poor defaults don;t make for good working-out-of-the-box experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem isn&#039;t with the defaults, the problem is that people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing are using the software.....

...which is OK, because one of the points of MySQL is to be easy to use, and that it&#039;s accessible even if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.  The problem is that in the interest of saving money and because things work &quot;well enough&quot; people don&#039;t have the expertise they need.

It would be like going to a &#039;learning&#039; doctor or dentist all the time -- sure, you can save money, but if you have anything other than standard issues (ie, not just a regular healthy visit, shots, or an &#039;easy&#039; issue like pink eye or the flu) then you want someone with experience.]]></description>

innodb_file_per_table: I &lt;a href=&quot;https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/mysql/reasons-to-use-innodb_file_per_table&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;agree&lt;/a&gt;, but some &lt;a href=&quot;http://dammit.lt/2009/05/21/innodb-tablespace/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;disagree.&lt;/a&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Also:

innodb_file_per_table should default to being set on; it&#039;s appropriate for probably 99% of the cases out there.

max_connections limit of 151 is ridiculous.  The only reason to have max_connections is so you don&#039;t crash due to trying to use too much memory.  So instead of crashing you block access, which results in the same problem -- customers don&#039;t see data.  

But really, these settings are easily found in a basic audit, and I&#039;d almost rather have these so you can tell that a server hasn&#039;t really been looked at, versus &#039;it&#039;s been looked at and the defaults are good&#039;.]]></description>
