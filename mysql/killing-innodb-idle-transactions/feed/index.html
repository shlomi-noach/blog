					<description><![CDATA[Nice trick. Didn&#039;t know it, thank you. For those who are looking for nice explanation of &quot;killing&quot; internals, http://www.dbasquare.com/2012/05/15/why-do-threads-sometimes-stay-in-killed-state-in-mysql/.
Btw, do you know how it looks like in 5.6?]]></description>

I should note that not all open transactions pose a problem. More interesting are open transactions which are known to hold locks. I will improve the view to include such info.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Peter,
An idle transaction is one where a BEGIN or START TRANSACTION have been issues, some queries may have been issued, but then lunch arrived and everybody left their desktop as they were and never COMMITed nor ROLLBACKed. 

Which means lock may be held by this open transaction, and are not being released.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI!

Could you please explain me the difference between an &#039;idle transaction&#039; and an &#039;idle connection&#039; (if there is any difference)?

If there is no difference then it is perfectly valid for some client environments (in particluar C/C++) to have an idle connection (in other words to keep the connection alive between queries).  This applies to most GUI tools, for instance, that may be kept open and connected the whole day.

I have the impression that this whole discussion (I saw the term &#039;idle transaction&#039; recently in some Percona blog too) that there are other client environments than PHP and JAVA whree an idle connection is not a problem.
