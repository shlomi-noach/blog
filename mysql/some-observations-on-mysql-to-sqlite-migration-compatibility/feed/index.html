					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be looking forward to read your blog post, Simon!
These are early stages, and I&#039;m still looking into the diffs between mysql/sqlite, and clearly expect to be looking more into the app behavioral changes.

While I&#039;m looking at this for an actual use case, I should note that orchestrator will continue to support mysql as backend (and I/we will continue to use it like that...).

You&#039;re right about the architectural changes that would be required of orchestrator. We discussed some of those in the past: sharing work between orchestrator nodes; taking leadership; getting quorum agreement for failover; operation locks.

I do believe with proper layering most of these changes would not have to complicate existing code, which would mostly be ignorant of the change. But -- ongoing effort, so we&#039;ll see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not heavyweight depends. For people in small environments then having a single app+db is great. There&#039;s no disagreement there, but if you want orchestrator to be HA because you don&#039;t want to have your db servers going down then that&#039;s not so good. So perhaps it&#039;s misleading to lead people to a &quot;this app fixes your problem mentality&quot; as they may think: just install orchestrator and my MySQL failover problems are solved. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s quite as simple as that. I am pending writing a blog on setting up orchestrator in a HA environment and obviously that&#039;s a lot more complex and maybe only makes sense if orchestrator is monitoring a number of servers.

If I were to do what you want I guess I would keep state in memory with a very basic setup on disk of the boxes to monitor (not their state) and if I needed HA I would exchange &quot;config&quot; and/or state with neighbours etc.   Basically like networking daemons exchange routing information. The idea sounds simple, but having seen and knowing the current code that&#039;s a major change in the way things work and quite a risky undertaking though maybe it would allow &quot;instant&quot; recognition of failure scenarios and therefore be &quot;better&quot; than now.  Most people don&#039;t really appreciate the complexity of what orchestrator does, the  situations it handles and in practice a new in-memory based orchestrator server would also be pretty complex.  It might be an interesting path to take but few people probably have time for such an adventure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[SQLite is a pretty good option to be compatible in the direction of MySQL, but if the SQLite db is heavily used the performance just won&#039;t cut it. Firefox with tons of data in its DBs is a good example on slow db. LibreOffice changes to Firebird 3.0.0.]]></description>
