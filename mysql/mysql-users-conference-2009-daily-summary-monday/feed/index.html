					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi! 

thanks for attending, it was great to have you. I&#039;m glad you liked the session.

While it&#039;s true that the daemon, information_schema and storage engine plugins cannot be considered clean, the audit and fulltext plugins are. So, like Sergei mentioned, his original 2 year old fulltext code still works just fine.

Of course, I agree completely that it would be even better if the same would hold for the other plugin types. That said, I think that if you want to use  information_schema plugins for reporting interesting things in the server, we probaly can&#039;t expect it to happen in the short term, as it would presuppose the entire server to be built of modules that have  a public API to report status.

Anyway, thanks again, and let me know if you need any help building plugins. 

kind regards,

Roland]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Bill,

Thanks for commenting! I think I may need to learn how to phrase myself better: I absolutely do not see any problem with discussing basic and trivial material in the UC. 
I actually think it&#039;s very important. Your discussion on ENUM and FLOAT was to the point, and if I were to pick a random MySQL DBAs audience, I would have no doubt that a great many of them would not have such topic clear in their heads. 
So, I was merely expressing my own personal preference.

An example from today&#039;s class would be a guy who thought an index over a VARCHAR column would not work for a &quot;LIKE &#039;a/b/c/d/%&#039;. Therefore, this particular discussion alone was extremely beneficial to that guy.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for attending my tutorial Shlomi.  I enjoyed the participation of the attendees too.  FWIW, the purpose of my talk was to present solutions to mistakes I see frequently in questions posted online.  Seemingly rudimentary topics like improper use of ENUM and FLOAT and NULL are nevertheless common blunders.  But I understand that they may be basic for attendees as a MySQL conference!]]></description>
