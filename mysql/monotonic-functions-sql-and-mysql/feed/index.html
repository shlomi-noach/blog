					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi,
Can you elaborate this further?
&quot; If we were to look for a log entry from &#039;2009-02-07 11:58:00&#039; by simple SELECT, we would have to use a full table scan. But, by knowing that ts is monotonic, we can also use binary search on id.&quot;
So are you suggesting we take a count(*) AS c and then get MAX(id) as r, MAX(ts) as t from table order by id limit c and then use r and t to continue the binary search until we locate the exact time stamp in t?
If yes, won&#039;t that means writing lot of logic in application layer and also making more than 1 query to underlying db?]]></description>
