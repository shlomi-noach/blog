					<description><![CDATA[@Roland,

Wow. Here are a couple comments on that report, that are of interest. Just to put one in the scale of time.

-----------------------------------

Urgently needing this feature! Hope this feature will make it into 5.2!!

Aside from the suggested @@SQLSTATE and @@SQLSTATE_MESSAGE, another global @@MYSQLERROR (the MySql error number) would be highly appreciated with it&#039;s more detailed mysql-specific error mapping.

-----------------------------------

This is by far the most SERIOUS weak point of MYSQL from my point of view. We have written complex SP and are not able to proberly track exceptions due to this bug.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Davi,

Thanks!
But also: such brief comment makes it appear as if there is such a feature. 
It&#039;s great to learn that this feature is available in 5.6. But it&#039;s also important to know that 5.6 is not GA at this stage. It will take years to come before 5.5 and 5.1 are gone from production systems. It would be great to have such issues resolved in those versions as well. Ok, 5.1 is stretching it, I suppose.

I&#039;m very happy with many new 5.6 features. Many of these are Metadata related. It will take time before I even catch up with all the new featureset. Thanks for noting down this new one!]]></description>
