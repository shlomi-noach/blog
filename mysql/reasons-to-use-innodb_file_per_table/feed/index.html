					<description><![CDATA[Well, you&#039;re in a serious problem.
I would tell you to open your backup, but I&#039;m sure you&#039;re asking this question as you don&#039;t have one. Or you could rely on your replicating slave if you have one.
Depending on your file system, you may be able to restore the file itself.
If this is made possible, you may recover your innodb data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/percona-data-recovery-tool-for-innodb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;innodb-tools&lt;/a&gt;. But if you&#039;re down to that, you may seek out help from Percona, who author those tools.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@John, George,

Ah, but it has been more than two years since this post was published. Much has happened since.
In particular, the emergence of InnoDB Plugin (now just InnoDB), replacing the older &quot;builting&quot; InnoDB.
InnoDB Plugic comes with many improvements; performance, scale up, bugfixes, blob storage, ...
And to fully utilize its functionality (you can use half of its advantages without changing anything), you need to upgrade your tables to &quot;barracuda format&quot;. 
Guess what? It requires innodb_file_per_table.
So file-per-table is now also a feature issue. You loose features (e.g. compression, blob storage) which can directly relate to performance issues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been running several MySQL servers for a number of years. I have one particular box that has a little over 400 databases totaling about 350GB. The server was originally setup using 3 ibdata files back on 4.0, and was later changed to file per table. There has not been any appreciable speed difference from what I can see. The server is very busy, averaging 6-7 GB of binlogs per day. There is file system overhead for sure, but the db files are stored on a 16 spindle 6gb/s sas array, so I don&#039;t expect that any small gain would warrant moving back to single files again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hail from DB2 land and I really enjoyed the ability to put one or more tables of my choosing in a particular tablespace and others in another tablespace.

I totally agree with many of the points here about the filesystem overhead of having a file per table.  However, I also don&#039;t want all tables to be in one file. 

Is there not a happy medium in mysql?]]></description>
