					<description><![CDATA[I favor the CLI, although I use Workbench side-by-side, but not for admin tasks.

For example, if you only enable root@localhost to have GRANT OPTION (or replace with the administrative permission of your choice), it&#039;s not always easy or convenient to do port tunneling so you can use a GUI. OTH, the MySQL CLI utility will always be there on the server.

					<description><![CDATA[While I agree with you that the commandline is the ultimate tool, many times the extra layer(s) of abstraction help a developer get familiar with the MySQL environment and how queries actually work in MySQL, without having to learn a new tool also.  

There is value in exposing a little bit of MySQL at a time.

I use a separate editor for when I&#039;m creating stored procedures or events, long pieces of code that I likely will troubleshoot for a while before getting it right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being a Unix user, one of the reasons for using MySQL command line tools rather than GUIs is that with the CLi you can easily integrate other shell tools with MySQL input or output.
Admittedly, I am a proficient command line user, and therefore for me it is relatively easy to run a shell loop using input from the MySQL CLI tool and push back the output to MySQL, all in the same line. 
Like this:
$ for T in $(mysql -B -N -e &#039;show
tables from world&#039;) ;  do echo &quot;CREATE TABLE world2.$T LIKE world.$T;&quot; ; done &#124; mysql -vv

I understand that someone used to a GUI may look at that as an abomination, but for me this is one of the simplest uses of the MySQL CLI integrated to shell tools. There are more complex, and more powerful things that can be done, and I feel very much satisfied with the command line for this reason. I would be lost in a GUI, which is in many cases very limiting for me. 

When is a GUI helpful? When you have to create queries from a complex schema and you need an enhanced editor that suggests you table and column names efficiently. I use Aqua Data Studio for this reason only.]]></description>
