					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi,

Great post.  While I agree with you, I would clarify one thing:

Performance is really the measure of two things; (a) response (b) capacity.  INSERT delayed doesn&#039;t improve capacity in any way, but it can reduce the amount of time a user is sitting there waiting if the app is single threaded (like many web apps are).  Having said that, I&#039;ve never liked it.  I&#039;ve often thought of it as like a poor man&#039;s asynchronous queue.

In many cases the right tool is probably a message queuing system designed for this problem like openmq/activemq/rabbitmq etc.]]></description>
