					<description><![CDATA[Shlomi: don&#039;t be discouraged. It&#039;s not about who&#039;s first. I am pretty sure someone else figured this one out before me for that matter. They&#039;d have to I guess, I mean, in the early days MySQL didn&#039;t have subqueries and GROUP_CONCAT is an excellent device to work around subquery problems (in fact even now some queries that i&#039;d rather solve with a subquery are often solved with better performance using these hacks)

Personally, I feel the hackishness of GROUP_CONCAT will be fulfilled when it gets a LIMIT clause. It may sound crazy but the idea is that it will make things like the groupwise MAX much more efficient if no time is spent building a large string concatenating all the entries - you could just do LIMIT 1 and save a lot of memory and avoid a warning about group_concat_max_len too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Giuseppe - thanks!

Roland - good to see you here again, was a bit discouraged to have found your comment over there... Wasn&#039;t stealing though :)
Thanks for the median query link - nice one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! 

&quot;UPDATE: Turns out an anonymous comment to Kristian Nielsen&#039;s post suggested the same solution, about a week ago.&quot;

Yeah, it&#039;s mine. I try to sign those dreadful blog interfaces that require me to get an account, but apparently I forgot that time. 

BTW - I made a mistake in that particular example, as I forgot to include a DESC for the ORDER BY (the problem was selecting the last version - not the first)

					<description><![CDATA[Toby,

Not so. It was cheaper on my testing benchmarks. I am careful to say &quot;possible&quot; because I cannot guarantee it will be cheaper to use this index on *any* table in *any* database under *any* circumstance, is all.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Toby,

This post presents an alternative which is very cheap with the right index, possibly cheaper than a JOIN alternative.
