					<description><![CDATA[The worst thing about mysql is that there are times when it does not think it necessary to throw a warning (bug id: 43930).
For e.g.

mysql&#062; CREATE TABLE `table1` (`number` int(20) DEFAULT NULL) ENGINE=MyISAM;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql&#062; insert into table1 values (&#039;19.54&#039;);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql&#062; select * from table1;
+--------+
&#124; number &#124;
+--------+
&#124;     20 &#124; 
+--------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)

Or while MySQL starts even with Fatal Innodb errors? (bug id: 19027) There seems to be no way to log warnings on import. (bug id: 8684) You will need to write another post for the bugs (id: 29898) where DATE() function returns inconsistent results.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Gurjeet,

A bit far fetched in th context of this post. There are plenty of reasons to use MySQL, and very large companies run very popular products on MySQL, successfully. Seems like something&#039;s going right?

I think the web if full of database wars; but eventually, both MySQL and Postgresql (as example) are *good* database systems, and both have their pros and cons.
I think saying &quot;there&#039;s no reason to use MySQL, and PostgreSQL is far better&quot; is not too serious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are serious about your data, use something mature than MySQL. I don&#039;t see a reason why one would run MySQL instead of a more SQL compliant DB. There are quite a few out there, but my personal favorite is Postgres.

&lt;strong&gt;Added by shlomi, two days later:&lt;/strong&gt;
Gurjeet, you are most welcome in this blog. I hope you find it interesting and would like you to visit often. However, this comment does take the form of troll-speech. Since you work at EnterpriseDB, you cannot be completely naive or innocent.
Let me know if you want this comment to be altogether removed.]]></description>
