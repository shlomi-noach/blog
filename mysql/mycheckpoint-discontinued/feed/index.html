					<description><![CDATA[&quot;today there are more counters &#038; variables than possible table columns&quot;.

We (Webyog) realized this when developing MONyog. Refer http://blog.webyog.com/2009/07/29/monyog-database-schema-explained/

You cannot foresee what server and status variables will be availble in the future.  For that reason we implemented a key-value storage in SQL as described:

&quot;
1) Everytime MONyog sends a statement like SHOW VARIABLES/STATUS of some kind (or fetching a OS metric from Linux /proc folder) one row is INSERTED into [timestamp_master] table with information about current time and the metrics retrieved for each such statement will be INSERTED into [snapshot_master]. The [snapshot_master] table contains the metrics details. The [timestamp_id] column identifies when metric details were like that. And also note that timestamps in MONyog databases are unix_timestamps.

2) And actually we do not always INSERT into [snapshot_master]. Only if the particular metric was changed since last time something was INSERTED for that metric we will INSERT again. So if you want to find the value of a metric at some particular time you will need to find the most recent value stored before that particular time for that particular metric.
