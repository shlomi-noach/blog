					<description><![CDATA[The programming public is Boolean-challenged.  I get so irritated every time I see (in any of several languages)
if () x = TRUE else x = FALSE;

The equivalence of 0/false/off and 1/true/on will be hard to &#039;teach&#039;, regardless of which way you go.

I do agree that consistency would be nice.  Fortunately, MySQL is usually forgiving.

Another frustration:  The flags that are done by there presence/absence, perhaps including
log-slave-updates
skip-external-locking]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, this has annoyed me too, particularly early on. There&#039;s a discussion right now about refactoring the configuration management for Drizzle into a plugin, hopefully fixing this can be included in that project :)]]></description>
