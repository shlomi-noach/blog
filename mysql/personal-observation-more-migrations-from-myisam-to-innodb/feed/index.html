					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi

I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s been a significant shift in the existing trend, which was that people either deploy on or move to InnoDB.

Somewhat relevant is that non-Windows storage engine default becomes InnoDB from 5.5, but that&#039;s something that others had already dealt with in my.cnf anyway. Nevertheless, good.

In terms of development, we have not yet seen any releases from the new Oracle+Sun. What we&#039;ve seen so far was the earlier work led by Ken Jacobs at Oracle for the InnoDB 1.1 plugin, and Sun&#039;s existing work on 5.5. Ken is no longer at Oracle. So we&#039;ll have to see what the next release looks like, when it comes.

Regards,
Arjen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I&#039;m not an authority here, but here&#039;s what I believe:
1. The mysql database will not transition to InnoDB in the near future: it&#039;s just too much of a change for everyone.
2. Oracle owns MySQL &amp; InnoDB. They have owned InnoDB for the past 4 years, and they have developed the InnoDB plugin.
Please see my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/mysql/innodb-is-dead-long-live-innodb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; on InnoDB plugin.

					<description><![CDATA[Do you think that the mysql and information_schema databases will ever transition to InnoDB?

As someone who recently started on MySQL, I&#039;m a bit confused on the InnoDB plugin topic:
Does Oracle own the plugin? Will they merge it with the default distribution of MySQL? Will there always be an innoDB plugin as a separate entity with slightly more advanced features?]]></description>
