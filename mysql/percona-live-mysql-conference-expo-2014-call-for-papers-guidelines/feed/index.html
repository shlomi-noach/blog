					<description><![CDATA[To be clear: The only valid reason to be biased against talks about closed source products is an assumption that the audience will be less interested in them, because they are less likely to use them. This assumption is of course based on my personal preferences, but for example it is well known that the large US based web companies pretty much never use a closed source solution.

So it is not a political bias as such, just a reflection of what I believe is relevant to the audience.

That said, especially last year the committee was surprisingly positive towards those proposals. I suppose there&#039;s some value in having the greatest variety of talks too. (As luck would have it, one of the closed source products approved had become open source by the time the talk was delivered :-)]]></description>
