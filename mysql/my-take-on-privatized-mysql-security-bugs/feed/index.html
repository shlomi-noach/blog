					<description><![CDATA[&#062; crashing bugs can be treated as security bugs since a crash is a form of Denial of Service

99.9% of the crashes can only be triggered by a user who is logged in, and has permissions to do some  actions.  For example: judging from description of bug#67315, one needs to be able to create/invoke stored functions in order to cause the crash.

Well, if a user is logged in to MySQL, he can cause a DoS.  This has been known for years.  Popular blogs have provided examples how to cause a DoS:

If Oracle has considered this to be a problem worth paying attention to, I suspect we would have seen some development in that direction, like per-user quotas of memory/CPU/IO usage and stuff like that.  
I have not heard of them developing anything like that.]]></description>
