					<description><![CDATA[Sergei,

Short and fair explanation.
However, I disagree. MySQL &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; able to tell me about the foreign keys when asked for &quot;&lt;strong&gt;SHOW CREATE TABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, which is exactly how I produced the above table description.
So, it is able to specify the FK, along with the constraint names. In this case, it should be able to duplicate this definition for a new table.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Why is that? Why wouldn’t the constraints be duplicated? No explanation is given in the manual&quot;

This happens, of course, because CREATE TABLE ... LIKE duplicates a table definition as it&#039;s know to MySQL.

MySQL doesn&#039;t know about foreign keys, it parses and ignores FK definitions.]]></description>
