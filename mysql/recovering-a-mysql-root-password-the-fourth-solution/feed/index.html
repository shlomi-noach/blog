					<description><![CDATA[@strcmp
Ah! You meant database == schema. Indeed I was under the impression you meant copying it to another database (database == MySQL instance).
I often find the word &quot;database&quot; is overloaded: database can stand for schema, server instance, server type, dataset,...

Hey, this is a really nice solution. It deserves more than a comment on my blog. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@shlomi: It took a while to figure out why you think that. user.* is not a magic object but a normal MyISAM table, it is only special at its original place. Of course you shouldn&#039;t put it into another mysql schema/database/directory, that would mean overwriting another user list anyway, which is not our goal. But you _can_ put it into another schema on the same database, or into another database, just not into the mysql schema, I have recovered a root account this way some years ago, it definitely works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@strcmp: if you copy the user.* to another database, this overrides any UPDATE privilege you may have there.
But, yes, with mysqlsandbox, for example, and skip-grant-tables, this is easy enough.

@Ronald,
Ineteresting that I read point #3 as copy+paste tables, and I missed the hash editing. Apparently so has Aleksandr...
Thank you]]></description>
