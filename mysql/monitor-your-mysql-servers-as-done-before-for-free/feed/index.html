					<description><![CDATA[@Jonathan,
&quot;You can technically set that up in nagios, however.&quot;
And in Cacti, as well! 
I&#039;m here to stand up for mycheckpoint, of course :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say that I do like this tool. I especially like the &#039;custom queries&#039; features. I have had a lot of requests for custom queries such as - can you tell me how many orders we sold yesterday, because if its under a certain amount there may be a problem with the thing-a-mi-jig in the warehouse again.
You can technically set that up in nagios, however.

As for the comment above, I do not feel that the mycheckpoint&#039;s current measurements inflicts too much load on the server for me to worry about.

There may be a case that you need to install it for each database server, but hey.. its free... and you can just have one main server query the tables on each server&#039;s mycheckpoint tables.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OK .. thanks for taking the time to reply so detailed. I think I should reply back to 2 points:

1)
&quot;Why do you say python is non-cross platform though?&quot;.  I was referring Windows where Python is not &#039;native&#039;. It may be installed of course.  But most Windows users are unfamiliar with handling such Unix-style environments.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Peter,

1) mycheckpoint does not have to touch the servers it monitors. It need to write the data somewhere, and that can be a small MySQL server dedicated for storing monitored results. I *can* use the same servers being monitored.

mycheckpoint can run on the same machine as monitored MySQL server, or from a remote machine. The advantage of running it on same machine as server is then the ability to monitor OS data (disk IO, disk usage, load average, etc., all very basic). Or you can monitor remotely and skip OS monitoring.

It&#039;s definitely possible to have one mycheckpoint instance to maintain. If you want it to monitor 200 servers, just execute it 200 times with different &quot;--monitored-host&quot; and &quot;--database&quot;.
It does require a different schema for each monitored server.
See &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/remote-multiple-hosts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

I cannot at this time have a unified page of multiple servers on one page. It&#039;s a pending request, and I haven&#039;t got round to that.

2) mycheckpoint uses SimpleHTTPServer class from python. It&#039;s pre-built in any python distribution, to the best of my knowledge.
Why do you say python is non-cross platform though?

I do wish to make the point that mycheckpoint indeed is not tested on MS Windows; I have no knowledge about anyone using it on Windows.

So I would say mycheckpoint is 98% self-contained: it requires python (available on all unix machines), python-mysql (needs to be installed by user), and, like MONyog, external mail service.

3) Same. See here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/installation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; for required GRANTs.

So, for these three concepts, I don&#039;t see that great a difference.

---
Like I said, there&#039;s no comparison about the scope of the two. I&#039;ve worked alone on mycheckpoint for about a year on my spare time. I have no idea about the team size for MONyog; obviously a *whole lot* time has been invested.

I&#039;m not saying mycheckpoint is *as* feature rich as MONyog. It is not. MONyog has a richer feature set.

I&#039;m saying that saying &quot;like never before&quot; on custom queries is something that makes me want to write a blog post such as this one. 
&quot;Like never before&quot; is a marketing phrase, and that&#039;s fine; but I wish to point out there are plenty installations on mycheckpoint (I don&#039;t know how many, I&#039;m judging by downloads only) for whom &quot;like never before&quot; does not fit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for linking to MONyog. 

The main difference between concepts  (not discussing features) are, I think 

1) MONyog does not at all touch the server(s) monitored. Nothing stored here. Also nothing executable to run on the servers monitored.  MONyog is &#039;agentless&#039;. I don&#039;t know if you can monitor 200 MySQL servers and have only one  mycheckpoint instance to maintain? Can you (more or less easily) have a unified view of multiple MySQL servers in one page?

2) MONyog has built in its own HTTP daemon, its own database and its own script-intepreter (javascript) and does not depend on availability of a (non-cross platform) runtime (Perl, Python, .NET, whatever) on the system(s) where MySQL is running and/or MONyog is installed. MONyog is 100% &#039;self-contained&#039; (with the sole exception that an external service is required or mail- or trap-alerts) 

3) MONyog needs very few privileges to MySQL and to the systems where MySQL(s) is/are running - because you don&#039;t need to install and configure anything there.


Am I missing something?]]></description>
