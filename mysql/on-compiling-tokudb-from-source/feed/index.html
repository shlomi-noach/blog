					<description><![CDATA[Hrm... So my comment on mysqlperformanceblog related to myself trying to do the normal &quot;./configure &amp;&amp; make&quot; from the Percona build tarball.
I haven&#039;t tackled the error you&#039;re describing with the bash script. However, I see you are using the &quot;new method&quot; of building the source, whereas I was using the &quot;old method&quot;; haven&#039;t tried the new one as yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did not compiled by myself, just executed script:

scripts/make.mysql.bash --git_tag=tokudb-7.0.1 --mysql=mariadb-5.5.30 --cc=gcc --cxx=g++

I saw your comment with the same error on mysqlperformanceblog. Thanks anywasy for your answer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;./configure&quot; is the way Autotools works.  MySQL and MariaDB don&#039;t use Autotools, they use CMake instead.  You should read up on what CMake does, but it&#039;s basically the same as &quot;./configure&quot;, and it generates Makefiles (but it generates them in a separate build directory, which is often very useful, you can read up on &quot;cmake out-of-source builds&quot;).  If you go into this build directory you can type &quot;make install&quot; there.

You should pass &quot;--git_tag=tokudb-7.0.1&quot; as described in the README.  This will fetch a specific version for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Leif,

With regard &quot;make install&quot; -- great, but I never got to see a Makefile in the installation process. There is none. There are plenty Makefile instances in inner directories, but no one Makefile for the entire project. 
Of course if you generate a Makefile than a &quot;make install&quot; is wonderful. That&#039;s what I was suggesting myself: to have &quot;./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install&quot; (the last can be skipped).

Thanks for the link! Will look more closely into it. Question: since it builds directly from Git, does that mean I get a source code which is modified constantly? Or does it get a particular version?]]></description>
