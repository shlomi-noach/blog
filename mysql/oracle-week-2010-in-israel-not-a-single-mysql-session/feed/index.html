					<description><![CDATA[Sheeri,

Thank you for your kind approach. It&#039;s good to be affected.
I wasn&#039;t aware of the approaching Oracle Week; I only realized it was dawning a few days ago. I have not contacted anyone: looks like the schedule is all filled up?

Moreover, I will personally be unavailable throughout the week for reasons I cannot control. So, sadly, I don&#039;t even see a point for me in making noise for something I cannot support myself.

Regards]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shlomi,

I was approached at ODTUG (in June) and volunteered to help a particular person do a MySQL day in November in Israel (when I&#039;ll be there).  It looks like that is Nov 7-11, which is a week before I&#039;m there, so I wonder if it&#039;s even the same organizers (I arrive the 13th or 14th of Nov).  

Have you contacted the organizers and offered to speak, or at least let them know that there are MySQL folks willing to help?  Most of the time these things are left out by accident, because they just didn&#039;t know anyone who could do it.

(And yes, this has happened to me, organizing OpenSQLCamp, we are often mysql heavy because that&#039;s what we know, even though OpenSQLCamp is supposed to be so much more....)

Never attribute to malice....]]></description>
