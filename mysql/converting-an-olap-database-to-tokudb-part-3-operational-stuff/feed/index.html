					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt,

As you say, it&#039;s in production; we&#039;re running a mixed topology of TokuDB and InnoDB. We keep those InnoDB servers to be on the safe side.
We have two standing bugs, both relate to locking. In one bug we get frequent &quot;lock wait timeout&quot; upon concurrent writes to same table (even though for different areas). On another bug we get mysterious slowness on LOAD DATA INFILE, inconsistent -- just caught one today, and it relates to locks as well.

I should mention we&#039;re still doing YEARly partitioning even though we would really like to do DAYly or MONTHly -- due to open files issue mentioned in previous part.

Other than the above we&#039;re good. I haven&#039;t tested OLTP load, just OLAP (low write concurrency, infrequent big reads)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Shlomi! 

I&#039;m wondering how things are going, now that it&#039;s been in production for 6 months or so?

Best Regards]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Eyal,
File system is not the only issue here. The cleanup of the buffer pool is another major factor. When you DROP a table, the buffer pool locks down until all relevant pages are flushed out. Also see Lazy Drop Table feature in Percona Server.]]></description>
