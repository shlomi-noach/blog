					<description><![CDATA[@Jack,

BETWEEN â€™2011-07-26 00:00:00â€² AND â€™2011-07-26 23:59:59â€²  is correct as long as timestamps are in 1 second resolution. Again: 23:59:59 is the *beginning* of the last second.
When you have better resolution than 1 second (as already exists with MariaDB), this makes the query wrong, since it will *not* catch 23:59:59.01, for example.

Perhaps I should have been more general and talk about &quot;all the different kinds of temporal values, now and in the future&quot;.
Do also note than not many programmers are actually aware of the differences between TIMESTAMP and DATETIME. They choose either; they work out the same queries for both (they look the same, don&#039;t they?).]]></description>

+ date(timstamp_column)=&#039;2011-07-26&#039;  will work but this won&#039;t catch the indexes.

BTW is it July 26th, 2011 or July 26th, 2001 (check ur query) !! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@dror,
adddate() is fine. I tend to favor the use of INTERVAL, because it is such more intuitive for me.

@Baron
Yes, BETWEEN is inclusive, which is why it works correctly for now -- for as long precision is 1 second.

@Roland,
Yes, leap seconds, daylight savings etc. are all so nicely managed by time/date math within MySQL, I usually drop all application based calculations and just ask the DB to do the math.]]></description>
