					<description><![CDATA[@Sheeri,
With MyISAM tables, there&#039;s the UPDATE_TIME column in TABLES which notifies when .frm was last modified. But this does not apply to InnoDB.

Since I wish to cache any data within the TABLES, COLUMNS, etc. tables, I can&#039;t specifically rely on this and that columns to change or not to change (very bad phrasing, but I hope you get my meaning).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could you make caching longer? I know it&#039;s hard to see outside of the database, but the .frm file changes when the table structure changes. If the .frm file doesn&#039;t change, does any of the metadata you&#039;re referring to change? (that&#039;s a serious question, because the answer might be &quot;yes&quot; if you&#039;re looking at data/index size or the TABLE_ROWS field of the TABLES table, for example)

If you only are referring to the structure of the table, and not the nature of the data in it, then I bet you could come up with some kind of hack that writes to a common file when a .frm file has changed, and only update the cache for the tables/indexes/columns that have changed when they change, instead of re-reading all the definitions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Peter,
With regards to the view - they are working just great, no trouble given. It&#039;s just the information_schema querying on views. I don&#039;t know that should mean I was looking for trouble.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) 
Q: &quot;Does it make sense to query for the cached table on slave, to have it answer for master&#039;s data?.. Or is it fair enough, since we would usually expect master/slaves to reflect same schema structure?&quot; A: I don&#039;t think so if some binlog&#124;replicate_do&#124;ignore_db setting is used on master or slave.

2)
Jannes was faster than me here, but building a system that depends on VIEWs defined on VIEWS (defined on .. (.. on ..)) :-) with MySQL is a synonym for asking for problems.  The limitations with VIEWS in MySQL are well-known and anyone who has read (any edition of) &#039;High Performance MySQL&#039; would foresee the problems arise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jannes,
Yes, it&#039;s just the views. 
The deeper the nesting of views, the more memory is consumed, and the more danger for crash. 
Just before the crash, I see about 1GB of memory getting drained. I can guess that the recursive read from I_S is the root of the problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do just getting the VIEWs from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA make your server crash or only in combination with the caching? In other words, are your VIEWs already dangerous for anyone to use (risking runnning an INFORMATION_SCHEMA query on the one day)?

Maybe it would be worth it to work out what exactly in the VIEWs is triggering the crash?]]></description>

As I understand it, Oracle/MySQL query the information_schema quite a bit with their Query Analyzer product.

I hope I am directing you to the right person, but maybe http://www.markleith.co.uk can help with that.]]></description>
