					<description><![CDATA[&quot;MySQL plugins are a tricky business. To create a plugin, you must compile it against the MySQL version you wish the users to use it with.&quot;

It actually depends on what the plugin is using. If it only makes use of the plugin API, a single binary should work fine across a given major version. Problem is that larger (and more useful) plugins usually rely on server internals, which can change at any given version.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not being familiar with the coding of plugins, is there a reason why there are not interfaces or standard APIs that can be exposed to a plugin to allow it to be upwardly compatible rather than combined at the compiler hip?  This has been an issue for a long time, and it seems like a compatibility API layer is needed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is one of the major benefits of MariaDB. Unfortunately until now they didn&#039;t have anything for MySQL 5.5, so you were out of luck anyway, but the idea of including as much stuff as possible into the same installation is certainly great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reminded of the EXTENSIVE MediaWiki plugin library. They aren&#039;t necessarily maintained, but meta-info tells you which was the last version they were known to work with, which lets you be a better chooser. Also, if it&#039;s important enough to you, you can patch to a new version and post your changes for others.

On the other hand, it suffers from &quot;branchitis.&quot; I made extensive enhancements to a MySQL plugin, and someone else LATER made extensive enhancements and ignored mine -- now we have &quot;version wars...&quot;]]></description>
