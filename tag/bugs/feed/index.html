								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago I submitted <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=67315">Bug #67315: Crashing server by stored function referencing user defined variable in query</a>. If you press that link, you can&#8217;t see the bug (though I can as I submitted it).</p>
<p>This is due to Oracle&#8217;s policy for security-related bugs. Tomas Ulin, Vice President MySQL Development at Oracle , was kind enough to discuss Oracle&#8217;s policy with me, and these are the key points as I understand them:</p>
<p>Oracle&#8217;s basic approach is to protect its customers. By publicizing security-bugs, Oracle&#8217;s customers are vulnerable to black hatters attacks. Therefore Oracle takes measures and privatizes security bugs (crashing bugs can be treated as security bugs since a crash is a form of Denial of Service).</p>
<p>But what of a bug reported in a RC version, as was in my case? There is no strict policy there, according to Ulin. However with a version this close to GA, it is uncertain that a specific bug would be fixed in time. It may happen, then, that a bug would find itself well into GA releases, thereby exposing customers to attacks.</p>
<p>Moreover, GA bugs that are already fixed may remain private, as customers will not necessarily haste to upgrade their working servers for every bug fix.</p>
<h4>My take</h4>
<p>Bug privatization has disadvantages, as well:<span id="more-5735"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>One could be left with the knowledge that there&#8217;s some serious bug in one&#8217;s server, but with no way to defend oneself, or take measures against hitting that bug</li>
<li>Forks are left outside; and for maintainer could try and tackle that bug, thereby improving the product. But with private bugs, forks just have to sit and wait idly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily have to have a take on this, but I got curious: how do other organizations work? And very quickly, I got <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Bugs#Embargoed_Security_Issues">here</a>. And although the domain reads <em>fedoraproject.org</em>, this is also the RedHat Enterprise Linux way of doing it. A bug can be embargoed, even if it&#8217;s upstream.</p>
<p>RedHat/Fedora have a notion of embargo expiry time; but I don&#8217;t know exactly how that works &#8211; I did some looking but could not determine that there is a fixed expiry time at the time of embargo.</p>
<p>Comparing RedHat/Fedora&#8217;s and Oracle&#8217;s approaches, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s that much of a difference. Perhaps Oracle is stricter. I did not make a thorough research, but the logic makes sense to me, which makes the policy reasonable in my view.</p>
