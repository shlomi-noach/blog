								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to a busy <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/e17/">Percona Live Dublin</a> conference, delivering three talks. Chronologically, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/e17/sessions/practical-orchestrator-tutorial"><strong>Practical orchestrator tutorial</strong></a><br />
Attend this 3 hour tutorial for a thorough overview on orchestrator: what, why, how to configure, best advice, deployments, failovers, security, high availability, common operations, &#8230;<br />
We will of course discuss the new <a href="https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/mysql/orchestrator-3-0-2-ga-released-raft-consensus-sqlite">orchestrator/raft</a> setup and share our experience running it in production.<br />
The tutorial will allow for general questions from the audience and open discussions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/e17/sessions/why-open-sourcing-our-database-tooling-was-smart-decision-keynote"><strong>Why Open Sourcing Our Database Tooling was the Smart Decision</strong></a><br />
What it says. A 10 minute journey advocating for open sourcing infrastructure.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/e17/sessions/mysql-infrastructure-testing-automation-at-github"><strong>MySQL Infrastructure Testing Automation at GitHub</strong></a><br />
Co-presenting with <a href="http://github.com/tomkrouper">Tom Krouper</a>, we share how &amp; why we run infrastructure tests in and near production that gives us trust in many of our ongoing, ever changing operations. Essentially this is &#8220;why you should feel OK trusting us with your data&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you there!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week I will be presenting <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/17/sessions/practical-orchestrator">Practical Orchestrator</a> at Percona Live, Santa Clara.</p>
<p>As opposed to previous <a href="https://github.com/github/orchestrator"><code>orchestrator</code></a> talks I gave, and which were either high level or algorithmic talks, <strong>Practical Orchestrator</strong> will be, well&#8230; practical.</p>
<p>The objective for this talk is that attendees leave the classroom with a good grasp of <code>orchestrator</code>&#8216;s powers, and know how to set up <code>orchestrator</code> in their environment.</p>
<p>We will walk through discovery, refactoring, recovery, HA. I will walk through the most important configuration settings, share advice on what makes a good deployment, and tell you how we and others run <code>orchestrator</code>. We&#8217;ll present a few scripting/automation examples. We will literally set up <code>orchestrator</code> on my computer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <strong>50</strong> minute talk and it will be fast paced!</p>
<h3>ProxySQL &amp; Orchestrator BoF</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.proxysql.com/">ProxySQL</a> is all the rage, and throughout the past 18 months René Cannaò and myself discussed a few times the potential for integration between ProxySQL and Orchestrator. We&#8217;ve also received several requests from the community.</p>
<p>We will run a BoF, a very informal session where we openly discuss our thoughts on possible integration, what makes sense and what doesn&#8217;t, and above all else would love to hear the attendees&#8217; thoughts. We might come out of this session with some plan to pick low hanging fruit, who knows?</p>
<p>The current link to the BoF sessions is <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/17/sessions/birds-feather-sessions">this</a>. It seems terribly broken, and hopefully I&#8217;ll replace it later on.</p>
<h3>GitHub talks</h3>
<p>GitHub engineers will further present these talks:<span id="more-7704"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/17/sessions/gh-ost-triggerless-painless-trusted-online-schema-migrations">gh-ost: triggerless, painless, trusted online schema migrations</a><br />
<strong>Jonah Berquist</strong>, <em>25 April &#8211; 2:20 PM &#8211; 3:10 PM @ Ballroom D</em><br />
This is the &#8220;classic&#8221; introduction to <a href="https://github.com/github/gh-ost">gh-ost</a>, our very own open source schema migration tool. <code>gh-ost</code> enjoys good traction and adoption. For us, it made a significant impact on our development cycle and on our availability and reliability. We hear similar stories from users. This talk will explain how <code>gh-ost</code> works and why it works for us and others so much better. Also: superpowers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/17/sessions/automating-schema-changes-using-gh-ost">Automating Schema Changes using gh-ost</a><br />
<strong>Tom Krouper</strong>, <em>27 April &#8211; 12:50 PM &#8211; 1:40 PM @ Ballroom D</em><br />
What&#8217;s the greater picture? <code>gh-ost</code> runs the migration, but what&#8217;s the migration cycle? How do our engineers design the change, get this to run, verify it doesn&#8217;t break our environment? What automation do we have in place? Expect very interesting and definitely not trivial issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/17/sessions/practical-json-mysql-57-and-beyond">Practical JSON in MySQL 5.7 and beyond</a><strong><br />
Ike Walker</strong>, <em>27 April &#8211; 3:00 PM &#8211; 3:50 PM @ Ballroom A</em><br />
Ike will review the JSON data type along with most recent changes, virtual columns, operational concerns and more. I&#8217;m looking forward to a great review!</li>
</ul>

<strong>Ivan Groenewold, Valerie Parham-Thompson</strong>, Pythian, <em>26 April &#8211; 5:00 PM &#8211; 5:25 PM @ Ballroom C</em><br />
Don&#8217;t take it from us. Pythian are running <code>gh-ost</code> in production, and on completely different environments than us. I&#8217;m absolutely curious to hear about their experience and findings.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/17/sessions/high-availability-gce">High Availability in GCE</a><br />
<strong>Carmen Mason, Allan Mason</strong>, <em>26 April &#8211; 3:30 PM &#8211; 4:20 PM @ Ballroom D</em><br />
This is a story on the road to MySQL HA on Google Cloud Engine. It ends up with MHA picked as the HA solution while <code>orchestrator</code> is not. I&#8217;m curious to hear!</li>
</ul>
<p>See you in Santa Clara!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a week&#8217;s time I&#8217;ll be speaking at <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/europe-amsterdam-2015/">Percona Live Amsterdam</a>. I will be presenting:</p>

</a>23 September 4:20PM<a href="https://www.percona.com/live/europe-amsterdam-2015/sessions/managing-and-visualizing-your-replication-topologies-orchestrator"><br />
</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This talk will present <strong><a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">orchestrator</a></strong>, on which I&#8217;ve been working for the last year and a half, originally at <a href="http://www.outbrain.com">Outbrain</a> and now at <a href="https://workingatbooking.com/">Booking.com</a>.</p>
<p>I will show off what <em>orchestrator</em> can do to manage your replication topologies. From visualization, through topology refactoring to automated crash recoveries, <em>orchestrator</em> today plays a key role at Booking.com infrastructure, at scale (oh I love using these words).</p>
<p>You can expect an outrageous demo, a visual walkthrough, some command line examples, and a lot on the logic and mechanisms behind <em>orchestrator</em>. I will present the difficult problems <em>orchestrator</em> covers.</p>
<p><em>orchestrator</em> is free and open source, and is built to be as generic as possible; it is known to be used by multiple well known companies these days, so please join the party.</p>
<p>With that, I conclude with the almighty motto:<span id="more-7396"></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some personal reflections on <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015/">PerconaLive 2015</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Percona acquires Tokutek</strong></p>
<p>Well done! Tokutek develops the TokuDB storage engine for MySQL and TokuMX engine for MongoDB. I will discuss the MySQL aspect only.</p>
<p>TokuDB was released as open source in 2013. It has attained a lot of traction and I have used it myself for some time. I met issues with locking or otherwise operational difficulties which I reported, and otherwise was fascinated by such features as great compression, online schema changes, and more.</p>
<p>Recently another company, InfiniDB, that also released its MySQL-backed codebase as open source, went out of business. I was afraid the same might happen to Tokutek.</p>
<p>I see Percona&#8217;s purchase as a very good move for the community. I saw a lot of TokuDB interest in Percona for some time now, and it is clearly interested in the technology. I expect they will add their own hands-on experience into the development of more operations-friendly features; put effort in solving locking issues (it&#8217;s been a while since I last checked, of course some of these may have been addressed by now). I am guessing they will work on a Galera/TokuDB integration and offer a &#8220;Toku-XtraDB-Cluster&#8221;.</p>
<p>TokuDB can compete with InnoDB in many places, while in others each will have its distinct advantage.</p>
<p>I see this is as good news for the community.</p>
<p><strong>Community Awards and Lightning Talks</strong></p>
<p>On a completely different subject, I believe it is commonly accepted that this year&#8217;s setup for the community awards &amp; lightning talks was unsuccessful. The noise was astounding, human traffic was interrupting and overall this was a poor experience. We (Giuseppe Maxia, Kortney Runyan &amp; myself) made a quick, informal brainstorming on this and came up with a couple ideas. One of which we hope to try in the upcoming <em>Percona Live Europe &#8211; Amsterdam</em>.</p>
<p>We apologize to the speakers for the difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Percona Live Europe &#8211; Amsterdam</strong></p>
<p>Haha! Having recently relocated to the Netherlands I&#8217;m of course very happy. But regardless, Percona Live London was fun &#8211; and yet running on low fuel. I think it was a great idea to change location (and more locations expected in the future). This is the path taken by such conferences as OSCon, Velocity, Strata and more. Amsterdam in particular, as I&#8217;ve recently learned, is especially appreciated by many. I think this conf will do great!</p>
<p><strong>Woz</strong></p>
<p>And now for something completely different. Woz&#8217; talk was that. I&#8217;m happy he came; I appreciate that he discussed education; and it was fun.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In two weeks time I will be presenting <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015/sessions/pseudo-gtid-and-easy-replication-management">Pseudo GTID and Easy Replication Topology Management</a> at Percona Live. From the time I submitted the proposal a LOT has been developed, experimented, deployed and used with both <a href="https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/mysql/refactoring-replication-topology-with-pseudo-gtid">Pseudo GTID</a> and with <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">orchestrator</a>. In my talk I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest that you skip the &#8220;to GTID or not to GTID&#8221; question and go for the lightweight Pseudo GTID</li>
<li>Show how Pseudo GTID is used in production to recover from various replication failures and server crashes</li>
<li>Do an outrageous demonstration</li>
<li>Tell you about 50,000 successful experiments and tests done in production</li>
<li>Show off orchestrator and its support for Pseudo GTID, including automated crash analysis and recovery mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will further show how the orchestrator tooling makes for a less restrictive, more performant, less locking, non-intrusive, trusted and lightweight replication topology management solution.<span id="more-7205"></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And not for long!</p>
<p>The Call for Papers for <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015">Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo</a>, to be held at Santa Clara in April 2015, is open. The dead line for submissions is <strong>Nov. 16th</strong>; that&#8217;s just around the corner.</p>
<p>As with previous years, we will hold a <strong>4</strong> day conference, the first being a tutorials day and three days for sessions, BoF and lightning talks, as well as community events. The committee is expecting to review at about 250-300 submissions, out of which it will pick at about 100 talks to schedule or reserve.</p>
<p>We will be using these tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Availability</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Performance Optimization</li>
<li>Replication and Backup</li>
<li>MySQL in the Cloud</li>
<li>MySQL and NoSQL</li>
<li>MySQL Case Studies</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>What’s New in MySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>This year we will roughly pre-define the desired number of sessions we wish to have per track. This is not set in stone and everything is fluid. Yet, this will give us better guidelines at choosing and pursuing content for this conference.</p>
<h4>Submitting a proposal</h4>
<p>We encourage all members of the community to submit their tutorial/session/BoF proposals as soon as possible. Please register/login at the <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015/">conference home page</a>.</p>
<p>The guidelines for submitting a proposal are generally unchanged; please review past recommendations: <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-get-your-proposal-accepted-to.html">[1],</a> <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/12/19/how-to-write-a-good-mysql-conference-proposal/">[2]</a>, <a href="https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-and-expo-2012-a-note-on-proposals">[3], </a><a href="https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-expo-2014-call-for-papers-guidelines">[4]</a>. To add to all these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do note that we are likely to only review a proposal just once. Please submit only after you have finalized your draft.</li>
<li>Make a reasonable length of proposal. We believe 250 &#8211; 300 words are quite enough for a good proposal. Please don&#8217;t write an essay, and remember that you proposal is what gets printed on the schedule, and what is read by the conference attendees when choosing the next talk to go to.</li>
<li>Write a descent Bio.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-7155"></span></p>
<h4>The committee</h4>
<p>This year&#8217;s committee includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calvin Sun (Twitter)</li>
<li>Chris Schneider (Groupon)</li>
<li>Colin Charles (MariaDB)</li>
<li>Gwen Shapira (Cloudera)</li>
<li>Harrison Fisk (Facebook)</li>
<li>Jay Janssen (Percona)</li>
<li>Jeremy Cole (Google)</li>
<li>John Scott (Wellcentive)</li>
<li>Morgan Tocker (Oracle)</li>
<li>Patrick Gilbraith (HP)</li>
<li>Peter Zaitsev (Percona)</li>
<li>Sean Chighizola (Big Fish)</li>
<li>Shivinder Singh (Verizon Wireless)</li>
<li>Tamar Bercovici (Box)</li>
<li>myself, Shlomi Noach (Conference Chairman)</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking forward to reviewing your papers!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While on the plane back home I wrote down all my impressions from Percona Live 2014. Have lots of TODOs and great ideas to implement. Among all my impressions, there were a few anecdotes worth noting.</p>
<ul>
<li>5.6 GTID is still unfriendly. It will require complete shutdown &amp; reconfiguration of your entire replication topology; and some companies present hacks around this. Notable, Facebook recoded GTID related code (slave agrees to replicate with GTID even though its master still uses binlog coordinates). Booking.com have their own hack around slowly migrating their topologies. And in a great lightning talk we were shown how to patch MySQL such that the relay logs turn into a  consistent GTID-like coordinate system.</li>
<li>Galera replication has been implemented for TokuDB (only active-passive mode, not active-active). This came as a surprise to Tokutek ; apparently Codership did this within a few hours of work. The rest is up for Tokutek!</li>
<li>WebScaleSQL is a cool initiative that aims to assist in pushing commonly desired featured back upstream. It is Web Scale. It is also not a productio0n distribution and I do not expect it to be, It is not a fork that is meant for the common DBA to download and deploy.</li>
<li>Tungsten replicator has MySQL to Hadoop replication using staging tables &#8211; an auditing of changes that are group-deployed on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Still so many people unfamiliar with MySQLSandbox. It&#8217;s such a basic tool, especially for testing and local installations.</li>
<li>Still misconceptions about common_schema. Yes, I do use it on production.</li>
<li>Everyone has the same problems <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Replication is still queen of MySQL&#8217;s featureset. We&#8217;re still all about failing over, promoting, scaling via replication.</li>
<li>Linux rules. Where two MacBooks failed to connect to the projector, my Lenovo/Ubuntu Linux did the job just fine and saved the day.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In less than a month I&#8217;ll be giving these two talks at <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/">Percona Live</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">common_schema: DBA&#8217;s framework for MySQL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still unfamiliar with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema,</a> this will make for a good introduction. I&#8217;ll give you multiple reasons why you would want to use it, and how it would come to <em>immediate</em> use at your company. I do mean <em>immediate</em>, as in previous <em>common_schema</em> presentations I happened to get feedback emails from attendees within the same or next day letting me know how <em>common_schema</em> solved an insistent problem of theirs or how it exposed an unknown status.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll review some useful views &amp; routines, and discuss the ease and power of QueryScript. <em>common_schema</em> is a Swiss-knife of solutions, and all from within your MySQL server.</p>
<p>I am using <em>common_schema</em> in production on a regular basis, and it happened to be hero of the day in multiple occasions. I&#8217;ll present a couple such cases.</p>
<p><iframe title="common_schema 2.2: DBA&#039;s framework for MySQL (April 2014)" src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/izgbQzup8tu7jN" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/mysql-devops-outbrain">MySQL DevOps @ Outbrain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a technical talk touching at some cultural issues.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/about/what-is-outbrain">Outbrain</a>, where I work, we have two blessings: a large group of engineers and a large dataset. We at the infrastructure team, together with the ops team, are responsible for the availability of the data. What we really like is technology which lets the owners of a problem be able to recognize it and take care of it. We want ops guys to do ops, and engineers to do engineering. And we want them to be able to talk to each other and <em>understand</em> each other.</p>
<p>What tools can you use to increase visibility? To allow sharing of data between the teams? I&#8217;ll share some tools and techniques that allow us to automate deployments, detect a malfunctioning/abusing service, deploy schema changes across dozens of hosts, control data retention, monitor connections, and more.</p>
<p>We like open source. The tools discussed are mostly open source, or open sourced by Outbrain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain why these tools matter, and how they serve the purpose of removing friction between teams, allowing for quick analysis of problems and overall visibility on all things that happen.</p>
