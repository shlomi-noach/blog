<p>Yay! I got a booth!</p>
<p>I confess it was mostly deserted. My hero <strong>Allen Kinnard</strong>, whom I&#8217;ve never met before, was kind enough to volunteer to occupy the booth.<br />
So between him and me, both of course also looking to visit other booths and talk to people, the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a> booth was only moderately attended.</p>
<p>Well, this was the DotOrg Pavilion: free booths for free &amp; open source projects (e.g. OpenStack, PhpMyAdmin, etc.).<br />
We both did our best to explain <em>common_schema</em> to the visitors.</p>
<p>The booth was actually titled <strong>&#8220;common_schema &amp; openark-kit&#8221;</strong>. However I don&#8217;t recall that anyone asked me about <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/introduction.html">openark-kit</a>. Most were just interested in what <em>common_schema</em> was. I get that <em>openark-kit</em> is well known by now to many.</p>
<p>We did not have so many visitors, which played well with our occasional absence. But this was a last moment arrangement. In future events I may try to get things on top and have an army of volunteers to help me out (and I hope that by next time common_schema is widely used).</p>
<p><a href="https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cookie_monster.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6300" alt="cookie_monster" src="https://shlomi-noach.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cookie_monster.jpeg" width="200" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>Now for the criminal department: practically all other DotOrg booths came prepared, with printed material, giveaway stuff and the like. We were like way beyond &#8220;the minimalist&#8221;. We were &#8220;the poor and the pitiful&#8221;. So I asked Kortney if she could arrange me some decorations (pulling some strings &#8211; yeah!). We were thinking a bowl of candies or something. Eventually she brought a few dozen candies (no bowl) and laid them nicely on the table; very nice touch! Good mixture of colors, nice wave design.</p>
<p>And guess what? Visitors actually thought they may take one of our candies! Oh, I schooled them.<br />
But on Wednesday, when we arrived to the booth, a horrid sight stroke us: someone stole (and probably ate) 80% of our candies!<br />
Well, I hope you&#8217;ve got bellyache, and next time you should know there will be surveillance, candy-thief!</p>
