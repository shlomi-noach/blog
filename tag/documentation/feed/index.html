								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Documentation is an important part of any project. On the projects I maintain I put a lot of effort on documentation, and, frankly, the majority of time spent on my projects is on documentation.</p>
<p>The matter of keeping the documentation faithful is a topic of interest. I&#8217;d like to outline a few documentation bundling possibilities, and the present the coming new documentation method for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/" rel="nofollow">common_schema</a>. I&#8217;ll talk about any bundling that is NOT <em>man pages</em>.</p>
<h4>High level: web docs</h4>
<p>This is the initial method of documentation I used for <a title="openark kit" href="../../forge/openark-kit">openark kit</a> and <a title="mycheckpoint" href="../../forge/mycheckpoint">mycheckpoint</a>. It&#8217;s still valid for <em>mycheckpoint</em>. Documentation is web-based. You need Internet access to read it. It&#8217;s in HTML format.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly HTML format: I wrote it in WordPress. Yes, it&#8217;s HTML, but there&#8217;s a lot of noise around (theme, menus, etc.) which is not strictly part of the documentation.</p>
<p>While this is perhaps the easiest way to go, here&#8217;s a few drawbacks:<span id="more-4536"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re bound to some framework (WordPress in this case)</li>
<li>Docs are split between MySQL database (my underlying WordPRess storage) &amp; WordPress files (themes, style, header, footer etc.)</li>
<li>Documentation is separate from your code &#8211; they&#8217;re just not in the same place</li>
<li>There is no version control over the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a single source of documentation, which applies to whatever version is latest. It&#8217;s impossible to maintain docs for multiple versions. You must manually synchronize your WordPress updates with code commits (or rather &#8211; code release!).</p>
<h4>Mid level: version controlled HTML docs</h4>
<p>I first saw this approach on Baron&#8217;s <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2010/09/22/aspersa-gets-a-user-manual/" rel="bookmark">Aspersa gets a user manual</a> post. I loved it: the documentation is HTML, but stored as part of your project&#8217;s code, in same version control.</p>
<p>This means one can <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/introduction.html">browse the documentation</a> (<em>openark kit</em> in this example) exactly as it appears in the baseline. Depending on your project hosting, one may be able to do so per version.</p>
<p>The approach has the great benefit of having the docs tightly coupled with the code in terms of development. Before committing code, one updates documentation for that code, then commits/releases both together.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re also not bound to any development framework. You may edit with <em>vim, emacs, gedit, bluefish, eclipse,</em> &#8230; any tool of your choice. It&#8217;s all down to plain old text files.</p>
<h4>Mid level #2: documentation bundling</h4>
<p>One thing I started doing with common_schema is to release a doc bundle with the code. So one can download a compressed bundle of all HTML files. That way one is absolutely certain what&#8217;s the right documentation for revision <strong>178</strong>. There&#8217;s no effort about it: the docs are already tightly coupled with code versions. Just compress and distribute.</p>
<h4>Low level: documentation coupled with your code</h4>
<p>Perl scripts can be written as Perl modules, in which case they are eligible for using the <em>perldoc</em> convention. You code your documentation within your script itself, as comment. <em>Perldoc</em> can extract the documentation and present in man-like format. Same happens with Python&#8217;s <em>pydoc</em>. Baron&#8217;s <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2011/11/07/when-documentation-is-code/" rel="bookmark">When documentation is code</a> illustrates that approach. <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit</a> (now <em>Percona Toolkit</em>) has been using it for years.</p>
<p>This method has the advantage of having the documentation ready right within your shell. You don&#8217;t need a browser, nor firewall access. The docs are just there for you in the same environment where you&#8217;re executing the code.</p>
<h4>SQL Low level: CALL for help()</h4>
<p><em>common_schema</em> is a different type of project. It is merely a schema. There&#8217;s no Perl nor Python. One imports the schema into one&#8217;s MySQL server.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the low-level approach for this type of code?</p>
<p>For <em>common_schema</em> I use three levels of documentation: the mid-level, where one can <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/introduction.html">browse through the versioned docs</a>, the 2nd mid-level, where one can <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/downloads/list">download bundled documentation</a>, and then a low-level approach: documentation embedded within the code.</p>
<p>MySQL&#8217;s documentation is also built into the server: see the <strong>help_*</strong> tables within the <strong>mysql</strong> schema. The <em>mysql</em> command line client allows one to access help by supporting the help command, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; help create table;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The client intercepts this command (this is not server side command) and searches through the <strong>mysql.help_*</strong> docs.</p>
<p>With <em>common_schema</em>, I don&#8217;t have control over the client; it&#8217;s all on server side. But the code being a schema, what with stored routines and tables, it&#8217;s easy enough to set up documentation.</p>
<p>As of the next version of <em>common_schema</em>, and following MySQL&#8217;s method, <em>common_schema</em> provides a <strong>help</strong> table:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>DESC help;
+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field        | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| topic        | varchar(32) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| help_message | text        | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And a <strong>help()</strong> procedure, so that you can call for <em>help()</em>. The procedure will look for the best matching document based on your search expression:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; <strong>CALL help('match');</strong>
<strong>+---------------------------------------</strong>----------------------------------------+
| help                                                                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                               |
| NAME                                                                          |
|                                                                               |
| match_grantee(): Match an existing account based on user+host.                |
|                                                                               |
| TYPE                                                                          |
|                                                                               |
| Function                                                                      |
|                                                                               |
| DESCRIPTION                                                                   |
|                                                                               |
| MySQL does not provide with identification of logged in accounts. It only     |
| provides with user + host:port combination within processlist. Alas, these do |
| not directly map to accounts, as MySQL lists the host:port from which the     |
| connection is made, but not the (possibly wildcard) user or host.             |
| This function matches a user+host combination against the known accounts,     |
| using the same matching method as the MySQL server, to detect the account     |
| which MySQL identifies as the one matching. It is similar in essence to       |
| CURRENT_USER(), only it works for all sessions, not just for the current      |
| session.                                                                      |
|                                                                               |
| SYNOPSIS                                                                      |
|                                                                               |
|                                                                               |
|                                                                               |
|        match_grantee(connection_user char(16) CHARSET utf8,                   |
|        connection_host char(70) CHARSET utf8)                                 |
|          RETURNS VARCHAR(100) CHARSET utf8                                    |
|                                                                               |
|                                                                               |
| Input:                                                                        |
|                                                                               |
| * connection_user: user login (e.g. as specified by PROCESSLIST)              |
| * connection_host: login host. May optionally specify port number (e.g.       |
|   webhost:12345), which is discarded by the function. This is to support      |
|   immediate input from as specified by PROCESSLIST.                           |
|                                                                               |
|                                                                               |
| EXAMPLES                                                                      |
|                                                                               |

<p>I like HTML for documentation. I think it&#8217;s a good format, provided you don&#8217;t start doing funny things. Perhaps <em>TROFF</em> is more suitable; certainly more popular on Unix machines. But I already have everything in HTML. So, what do I do?</p>
<p>My decision was to keep documentation in HTML, and use the handy <em>html2text</em> tool to do the job. And it does it pretty well! The sample you see above is an automated translation of HTML to plain text.</p>
<p>I add a few touches of my own: SELECTing long texts is ugly, whether you do it via &#8220;<strong>;</strong>&#8221; or &#8220;<strong>\G</strong>&#8220;. The <strong>help()</strong> routine breaks the text by &#8216;<strong>\n</strong>&#8216;, returning a multi row result set. The above sample makes for some <strong>60+</strong> rows, nicely formatted, broken from the original single text appearing in the <strong>help</strong> table.</p>
<p>So now you have an internal help method for <em>common_schema</em>, right where the code is. You don&#8217;t have to leave the command line client in order to get help.</p>
<p><a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/">Giuseppe</a> offered me the idea for this, even while my own thinking about it was in early stages.</p>
<p>The next version of <em>common_schema</em> will be available in a few weeks. The code is pretty much ready. I just need to work on, ahem&#8230;, the documentation.</p>
