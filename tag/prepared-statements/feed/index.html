								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I very much enjoyed reading <a href="http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2012/06/16/overloading-procedures/" rel="bookmark">Overloading Procedures</a> by Michael McLaughlin: good stuff!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m dealing with similar issues in <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/query_script.html">common_schema/QueryScript</a>, where I implement a whole new scripting language within MySQL, interpreted by stored routines. I am now finalizing the next version of <em>common_schema/QueryScript</em>, with a major addition to the scripting language to put yet even more power at the hands of the programmer/DBA using simple, clean syntax.</p>
<p>Still hush hush, the development of that feature touched at the very same issues described in Michael&#8217;s post. Present in current release, these issues are intensified by the use and complexity of the new development. Here are a few insights of mine:</p>
<h4>Internal array implementation</h4>
<p>Like Michael, I started by implementing arrays through tables. That is, create a (temporary, in my case) table, wrap it up with a lot of stored routine code, and simulate an array. This array is not yet provided to the user, but is used internally for QueryScript&#8217;s own code.</p>
<p>Well, disappointment here: during load tests on intense structures, such as a <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/query_script_foreach.html">foreach</a> loop, where each iteration of the loop requires the creation of an array, I found that the current solution does not hold well on busy servers.</p>
<p>Seemingly, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with the creation of a new table every once in a while &#8212; and in particular a temporary table. However, I quickly found out that a busy server thrashes the table cache with such intense rate of creation/dropping of tables. The competition over the table cache mutex becomes intolerable and hogs not only the script&#8217;s execution but the entire server&#8217;s.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the issue of the type of array values &#8212; no going around using textual columns, of course, but &#8212; how long? A <strong>VARCHAR(32767)</strong> should be enough for any reasonable implementation, but &#8212; how much memory would that consume? Both <strong>MEMORY</strong> and standard temporary tables (<em>Percona Server</em> has that partially <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/09/06/dynamic-row-format-for-memory-tables/">resolved</a>) use a fixed row format, which means a 32K text is actually allocated in memory even when your value is &#8216;x&#8217;.<span id="more-4947"></span></p>
<p>The next release completely rewrites the internal array implementation. How does it work now?</p>
<p>By avoiding using tables in the first place. To implement arrays now, I chose to use a well formatted text, such that can be easily parsed and manipulated.</p>
<p>I chose XML format, for which MySQL provides with <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/xml-functions.html">a couple functions</a>. Far from covering real XML manipulation requirements, but with a little effort and hacking, can provide with a reasonable base for work.</p>
<p>This also means the entire array resides in a single string, and this can be implemented by a User Defined Variable. So &#8212; no tables!</p>
<p>Moreover, there is now no need for stored procedures, since no dynamic SQL is sued. It&#8217;s all functions, which makes for an easier access. And to wrap it up &#8212; no need to decide about value limits. What fits in the string is what you get.</p>
<p>This solution is not perfect, either, of course. There&#8217;s more CPU used to parse/manipulate the XML (not a bug problem on my work since arrays are typically small), allocation/reallocation of memory (any manipulation assigns a new value to the User Defined Variable), and handling of <strong>NULL</strong>s is more complex.</p>
<p>Bottom line: overdoing <strong>CREATE TABLE/DROP TABLE</strong>, even for <strong>TEMPORARY</strong>, can be a pain. Avoid it.</p>
<h4>Dyamic SQL</h4>
<p>You can&#8217;t invoke dynamic SQL from within dynamic SQL. There is a wide variety of additional commands that cannot be invoked by dynamic SQL.</p>
<p>This calls for some attention. If you want to be able to dynamically invoke server commands issued by the user, you either limit the user&#8217;s choice of commands, or you find another way.</p>
<p><em>QueryScript</em> is a classic <em>&#8220;interpreted by an interpreter&#8221;</em> code. I wish there was a better way, but I use stored routines to interpret <em>QueryScript</em> text. So the <em>QueryScript</em> interpreter takes care not to over do it. While just reading the script&#8217;s text and sending it for dynamic invocation is certainly easier to code, it makes for said limitations. Thanks to <a href="http://rpbouman.blogspot.co.il/">Roland</a>&#8216;s contributions, <em>common_schema</em> parses user&#8217;s text, analyses and find intended queries, and &#8212; sometimes &#8212; simply runs it without dynamic invocation. Think nested if-else statement.</p>
<p>Still, most user&#8217;s code is indeed invoked dynamically.</p>
<h4>Parsing by comma</h4>
<p>If a user provides a comma delimited string, it is very dangerous to parse it via comma. The text <strong>&#8216;one,two,three,four&#8217;</strong> seems fine, but what about <strong>&#8216;one,two,&#8221;hi, dad&#8221;&#8216;</strong>?</p>
<p>So <em>common_schema</em> does a lot of such parsing. It takes care to properly analyze quoted text. But more than that: since the parsing of such text is costly, <em>common_schema</em> translates such text to a well-formed delimited text, such that there is a known, unique delimiter, not to be found within quotes, such that be splitting using said delimiter we get the definite tokenizing of the text.</p>
<p>To illustrate how it works: it attempts an unlikely single-character delimiter. Consider <strong>&#8216;\0&#8217;</strong>. Is <strong>&#8216;\0&#8217;</strong> found in the original text? If not, we can once analyze the proper tokenization, then replace appropriate commas with <strong>&#8216;\0&#8217;</strong>. Wait, is <strong>&#8216;\0&#8217;</strong> found anywhere in the text? Then we try the even more unlikely delimiter <strong>&#8216;\0\b&#8217;</strong>, then the yet unlikelier <strong>&#8216;\0\b\r&#8217;</strong>, etc.</p>
<h4>QueryScript</h4>
<p>QueryScript is a way to write stored SQL code &#8220;the way it ought to be&#8221;: simple, clean, useful, dynamic, flexible, wicked cool. A lot is going on, and I have enough ideas to last a couple years worth of development. No intention to create a heavyweight, full blown language. On the contrary: the language is intended to be simple, lightweight, and provide with easy to access interface to complex SQL operations. <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/query_script.html">Start the journey here</a>.</p>
