<p>Here's the background: I'm testing many features of MySQL <strong>5.6.7-RC</strong> due to two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm verifying my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema">common_schema</a> installs and works properly on <strong>5.6</strong></li>
<li>I promised I would present a <strong>45</strong> minute <em>"what's new in MySQL 5.6"</em> seminar in the upcoming <a href="http://www.oracleweek.com/">OracleWeek (Israel)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of <em>common_schema</em>, I have managed to find one <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/67313">weird bug</a> (a behavior regression from <strong>5.5</strong>) and one <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/67315">server-crashing bug</a>, by merely running the project's<strong></strong> tests, known to pass on <strong>5.1</strong> and <strong>5.5</strong> (and not utilizing any <strong>5.6</strong> features).</p>
<p>In the case of my presentation, I'm getting acquainted with new syntax and functionality, and am getting <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/thoughts-on-mysql-5-6-new-replication-features">unexpected results</a>. I've hit replication issues and <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/innodb-ddl-kudos-to-quick-responders-on-bugs-mysql-com">locking issues</a> in online DDL.</p>
<p>If I am able to find these bugs within a few hours of experimenting &amp; testing, then it is safe to assume we can extrapolate to many more bugs. This is not surprising; <strong>5.6</strong> boasts some <strong>120</strong> new features (I didn't actually count them). Of course they would introduce new bugs.</p>
<p>The moral is this: if you're interested in <strong>5.6</strong> as I am - and there's a lot to wait for - please consider experimenting with it, and report as many bugs to <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/">bugs.mysql.com</a> as possible. Reporting bugs is the user's authoritative way of improving an open source product and pushing towards a stable release. Provide your feedback today!</p>
