<p>I had the pleasure of speaking on two excellent podcasts:</p>
<h4>OurSQL</h4>
<p>No need for me to introduce this podcast. I just have to say it was only when I interviewed that I realized the amount of work taken for producing one single cast. Kudos to Sheeri &amp; Gerry and Rich Goyette the sound producer and thank you for your kind hospitality!</p>
<p>You can find the cast on <a href="http://technocation.org/content/oursql-episode-129%3A-new-and-extended">OurSQL Episode 129: New and Extended</a>, where we speak about the upcoming <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo, 2013</a>.</p>
<h4>Reversim</h4>
<p>This is an Israeli, Hebrew speaking podcast, and is undoubtedly the queen of Software Development podcasts here. Run by two enthusiast, veteran, open source keen developers, this is a <em>must hear</em> podcast if your Hebrew isn't rusty ;) Thanks Ori &amp; Ran for having me again!</p>
<p>I was honored to be interviewed for the 3rd time there, again speaking about MySQL and its ecosystem. In this recent podcast, I speak about the new 5.6 release, highlighting some features; about MariaDB; the Galera cluster technology; LGPL connectors; Percona Live 2013.</p>
<p>Find the cast on the <em>reversim</em> website: <a href="http://www.reversim.com/2013/03/171-mysql-56.html">171 MySQL 5.6</a></p>
<p>My next speaking event will be at the conference itself; more on that later.</p>
