<h4>Oracle</h4>
<p>Oracle? Oracle! We're extremely happy to have Oracle as presenter in Percona Live 2013!</p>
<p>You can expect three sessions by Oracle engineers:</p>
<p>• <a title="MySQL 5.6: Performance Benchmarks, Tuning, and Best Practices" href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-56-performance-benchmarks-tuning-and-%E2%80%9Cbest%E2%80%9D-practices" target="_blank">MySQL 5.6: Performance Benchmarks, Tuning, and Best Practices</a> - Dmitri Kravtchuk</p>
<p>• <a title="MySQL 5.6: What's New in InnoDB" href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-56-whats-new-innodb" target="_blank">MySQL 5.6: What’s New in InnoDB</a> - Sunny Bains</p>
<p>• <a title="MySQL 5.6: Redefining Replication" href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-56-redefining-replication" target="_blank">MySQL 5.6: Redefining Replication</a> - Luís Soares</p>
<p>And Tomas Ulin will present the obligatory "<a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/the-state-of-the-dolphin">State of the Dolphin</a>" keynote.</p>
<p>Skip my part in this conference for the moment; I'm very happy this is happening. For the community this is an obvious gain. I also wish to congratulate both Oracle and Percona for pulling this off; both parties deserve warm words here.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/03/12/oracle-technical-experts-at-the-percona-live-mysql-conference-and-expo/">announcement here</a>.</p>
<h4>BoF</h4>
<p>Birds of a Feather schedule is published. This happens on Tuesday, second day of the conference and <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/program/schedule/sessions-day-1">first day of conference sessions</a>, 6:00pm to 7:00pm. The BoF sessions are reviewed by the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/conference-committee">conference committee</a>.</p>
<h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
<p>Lightning talks are very short, rapid talks. We have 9 talks, totaling at about one hour. Giuseppe Maxia is orchestrating the talks. The talks are presented during the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/program/schedule/sessions-day-2">Community evening</a>, Wednesday, 5:30pm to 8:30pm, where community awards are also presented. Giuseppe will naturally elaborate on that.</p>
<p>For me excitement is quickly building up!</p>
