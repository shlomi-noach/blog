title: 'Introducing audit_login: simple MySQL login logfile based auditing'

<p><a href="https://github.com/outbrain/audit_login">audit_login</a> is a simple MySQL login auditing plugin, logging any login or login attempt to log file in JSON format.</p>
<p>It seems that audit plugins are <a href="http://serge.frezefond.com/2013/09/news-mariadb-audit-plugin-beta-is-out/">all the rage</a> lately... We've developed out simple plugin a month ago as part of our database securing efforts; by auditing any login or login attempt we could either intercept or later investigate suspicious logins.</p>
<p>However we quickly realized there is much more to be gathered by this info.</p>
<p>In very short, you install this plugin onto your MySQL server, and your server starts writing into a text file called <strong>audit_login.log</strong> entries such as follows:</p>

<p>In the above your MySQL server is on <strong>gromit03</strong>, and is accepting connections from other hosts; some successful, some not. What kind of information can you gather from the above?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can tell how many connections are being created on your server</li>
<li>Where they came from</li>
<li>Where <strong>'root'</strong> connections come from</li>
<li>Port scans (see last row) can be identified by no credentials. These don't have to be port scans <em>per se</em>; any <strong>telnet localhost 3006</strong> followed by <strong>Ctrl+D</strong> will show the same. Typically these would be either load balancer or monitoring tools checks to see that the <strong>3306</strong> port is active.</li>
<li>You can tell which accounts connect, and how many times</li>
<li>And you can infer which accounts are stale and can be dropped -- if an account does not connect within a week's time, it's probably stale (pick your own timeframe)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is quite interesting on one host; but we have dozens. We've installed this plugin on all our MySQL servers, and we use <a href="http://logstash.net/"><strong>logstash</strong></a> to aggregate them. We aggregate to two destinations:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>All logs are being sent over to <strong><a href="http://kibana.org/">kibana</a></strong>, where they are easily searchable via <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/">lucene</a> queries</li>
<li>They are also all aggregated into one CSV formatted logfile, rotating daily; this format makes it easier for me to <strong>grep</strong> and <strong>uniq -c</strong> and generally produce very valuable data by scripting.</li>
</ul>
<p>By aggregating the logs from multiple hosts, we are able to gather such insight as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well our load balancers are distributing connections</li>
<li>How our various applications servers connect on our multiple data centres to our MySQL hosts</li>
<li>Catching misbehaving apps with hardcoded server IPs</li>
<li>Catching naughty developers logging into our masters directly (we have more mechanisms now to prevent and audit such cases)</li>
<li>Identifying differences in behaviour of monitoring tools across our data centres</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Free to use</h4>
<p>The <strong>audit_login</strong> plugin has been made free to use, open source, licensed under GNU GPL v2. It is <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/audit_login">publicly available in our github repository</a>, where more documentation on build and installation can be found.</p>
<p>As MySQL plugins go, you must compile your plugin with your particular MySQL version. For you convenience, pre-compiled binaries are <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/audit_login/tree/master/lib">available in the repository</a> (at this time for <strong>5.5.32</strong> and <strong>5.5.21</strong> linux 64 bit; likely to add more)</p>
