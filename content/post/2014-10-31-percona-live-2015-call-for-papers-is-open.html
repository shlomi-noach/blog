<p>And not for long!</p>
<p>The Call for Papers for <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015">Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo</a>, to be held at Santa Clara in April 2015, is open. The dead line for submissions is <strong>Nov. 16th</strong>; that's just around the corner.</p>
<p>As with previous years, we will hold a <strong>4</strong> day conference, the first being a tutorials day and three days for sessions, BoF and lightning talks, as well as community events. The committee is expecting to review at about 250-300 submissions, out of which it will pick at about 100 talks to schedule or reserve.</p>
<p>We will be using these tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Availability</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Performance Optimization</li>
<li>Replication and Backup</li>
<li>MySQL in the Cloud</li>
<li>MySQL and NoSQL</li>
<li>MySQL Case Studies</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Whatâ€™s New in MySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>This year we will roughly pre-define the desired number of sessions we wish to have per track. This is not set in stone and everything is fluid. Yet, this will give us better guidelines at choosing and pursuing content for this conference.</p>
<h4>Submitting a proposal</h4>
<p>We encourage all members of the community to submit their tutorial/session/BoF proposals as soon as possible. Please register/login at the <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015/">conference home page</a>.</p>
<p>The guidelines for submitting a proposal are generally unchanged; please review past recommendations: <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-get-your-proposal-accepted-to.html">[1],</a> <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/12/19/how-to-write-a-good-mysql-conference-proposal/">[2]</a>, <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-and-expo-2012-a-note-on-proposals">[3], </a><a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-expo-2014-call-for-papers-guidelines">[4]</a>. To add to all these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do note that we are likely to only review a proposal just once. Please submit only after you have finalized your draft.</li>
<li>Make a reasonable length of proposal. We believe 250 - 300 words are quite enough for a good proposal. Please don't write an essay, and remember that you proposal is what gets printed on the schedule, and what is read by the conference attendees when choosing the next talk to go to.</li>
<li>Write a descent Bio.</li>
</ul>
