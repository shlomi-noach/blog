<p>How would you check whether some <strong>TIMESTAMP</strong> column falls within a given day, say <strong>July 26th, 2011</strong>?</p>
<p>This is a question I tend to ask students, and usually I get the same range of answers. Some are wrong; some cannot utilize an index, some are correct, and some are <em>temporarily correct</em>. I wish to take a closer look at the last. Such an answer looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE timstamp_column BETWEEN '2011-07-26 00:00:00' AND '2011-07-26 23:59:59'</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Yikes! I get my allergies when I see this one.</p>
<p>Technically this seems correct. And it seems to work so far for people. There are two things that disturb me:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>'23:59:59'</strong> refers to the beginning of the last second of the day. This means a full second is missing in concept. No one would write such a code on a C, Java or PHP application: that would be a newbie's mistake. But people feel at ease doing it with SQL</li>
<p>Of course, this works when timestamps are in a one second resolution. Which leads me to:</p>
<li>One second resolution is a temporary issue. Already <a href="http://kb.askmonty.org/en/what-is-mariadb-53">MariaDB 5.3</a> presents with microsecond support for NOW() and TIMESTAMP, TIME and DATETIME columns. Sometime in the not-so-far future the standard MySQL distribution will have that, too.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more-->Soon people will start losing data, reporting wrong numbers, perform incorrect aggregations. My advise:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>grep -iR "23:59:59" /path/to/application/code/*</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And get rid of it. A good alternative would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE timstamp_column &gt;= DATE('2011-07-26') AND timestamp_column &lt; (DATE('2011-07-26') + INTERVAL 1 DAY)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>(Why use all this INTERVAL stuff? Think <strong>28/29/30/31</strong> days in month and get the answer)</p>
<p>And do not use <strong>LIKE '2011-07-26 %'</strong>. Read <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/beware-of-implicit-casting">this</a> if you're not sure why.</p>
