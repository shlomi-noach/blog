<p>Unless your MySQL is configured to use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-sql-mode.html#sqlmode_ansi_quotes"><strong>ANSI_QUOTES</strong></a> in <strong>sql_mode</strong>, you are able to quote your text in one of two forms: using single quotes or double quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>UPDATE world.Country SET HeadOfState = <strong>'Willy Wonka'</strong> WHERE Code=<strong>'USA'</strong>
UPDATE world.Country SET HeadOfState = <strong>"Willy Wonka"</strong> WHERE Code=<strong>"USA"</strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes for JavaScript- or Python-style quoting: you quote by your needs. Say you have a text which includes single quotes:</p>
<blockquote><em>It is what you read when you don't have to that determines what you will be when you can't help it.</em> - Oscar Wilde</blockquote>
<p>You wish to insert this text to some tables. You could go through the trouble of escaping it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>INSERT INTO quotes (quote, author) VALUES (
&nbsp; 'It is what you read when you don\'t have to that determines what you will be when you can\'t help it.', 'Oscar Wilde');</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or you could just wrap it in double quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>INSERT INTO quotes (quote, author) VALUES (
&nbsp; "It is what you read when you don't have to that determines what you will be when you can't help it.", 'Oscar Wilde');</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this useful when using SQL to generate queries. Take, for example, <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-eval">eval() for MySQL</a>: the statement:<span id="more-4364"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>CALL eval('select concat(\'KILL \',id) from information_schema.processlist where user=\'webuser\'');</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>is just so more easily written this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>CALL eval("select concat('KILL ',id) from information_schema.processlist where user='webuser'");</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't suggest one should use this method throughout her application code. Application code works great with auto-escaping string literals. But for the handy DBA or developer, who needs to work some quick queries by hand, this makes for an easier syntax to use.</p>
