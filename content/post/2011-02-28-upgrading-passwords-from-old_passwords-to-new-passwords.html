title: Upgrading passwords from old_passwords to "new passwords"

<p>You have <strong>old_passwords=1</strong> in your <strong>my.cnf</strong>. I'm guessing this is because you used one of the <strong>my-small.cnf</strong>, <strong>my-large.cnf</strong> etc. templates provided with your MySQL distribution.</p>
<p>These files can easily win the "most outdated sample configuration file contest".</p>
<p>Usually it's no big deal: if some parameter isn't right, you just go and change it. Some variables, though, have a long-lasting effect, and are not easily reversed.</p>
<h4>What's the deal with old_passwords?</h4>
<p>No one should be using these anymore. This variable makes the password hashing algorithm compatible with that of MySQL <strong>4.0</strong>. I'm pretty sure <strong>4.0</strong> was released <strong>9</strong> years ago. I don't know of anyone still using it (or <strong>4.0</strong> client libraries).</p>
<p>The deal is this: with old_passwords you get a <strong>16</strong> hexadecimal digits (<strong>64</strong> bit) hashing of your passwords. With so called <em>"new passwords"</em> you get <strong>40</strong> hexadecimal digits (plus extra "<strong>*</strong>"). So this is about better encryption of your password. Read more on the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/password-hashing.html">manual</a>.</p>
<h4>How do I upgrade to new password format?</h4>
<p>You can't just put a comment on the "<strong>old_passwords=1</strong>" entry in the configuration file. If you do so, the next client to connect will attempt to match a <strong>41</strong> characters hashed password to your existing <strong>16</strong> characters entry in the <strong>mysql.users</strong> table. So you need to make a simultaneous change: both remove the <strong>old_passwords</strong> entry and set a new password. You must know all accounts' passwords before you begin.</p>
<p><!--more-->Interestingly, <strong>old_passwords</strong> is both a global and a session variable. To work out an example, let's assume the account <strong>'webuser'@'localhost'</strong> enters with '123456'. Take a look at the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SET SESSION old_passwords=0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SELECT PASSWORD('123456');
+-------------------------------------------+
| PASSWORD('123456')                        |
+-------------------------------------------+
| *6BB4837EB74329105EE4568DDA7DC67ED2CA2AD9 |
+-------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SET SESSION old_passwords=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SELECT PASSWORD('123456');
+--------------------+
| PASSWORD('123456') |
+--------------------+
| 565491d704013245   |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the <strong>PASSWORD()</strong> function consults the <strong>old_passwords</strong> session variable.</p>
<p>To upgrade <strong>'webuser'@'localhost'</strong>'s password we do:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SET SESSION old_passwords=0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SET PASSWORD FOR 'webuser'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('123456')</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Go ahead and see the <strong>password</strong> entry on the <strong>mysql.users</strong> table.</p>
<p>What we've just done is to set a <strong>41</strong> characters password hash for that account. Now, the next time the client wishes to connect, it must know in advance it is to expect a new password, otherwise it will encode a <strong>16</strong> characters hash, and try to match it with our new <strong>41</strong> characters hash. It is now time to perform:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>root@mysql-5.1.51&gt; SET GLOBAL old_passwords=0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will apply to all new connections made from that moment on (not affecting any existing connections). So, make sure you have updated passwords for all accounts.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, don't forget to set <strong>old_passwords=0</strong> in the <strong>my.cnf</strong> file, or, better yet, completely remove the entry.</p>
