<p>Here are a few questions remained open for me from Percona Live 2013 about things that have been said during keynotes; I will appreciate a discussion on comments. Here goes:</p>
<h4>Question #1</h4>
<blockquote><a href="www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/keynote-panel-impact-mysql-56-and-its-future-x">Brian Aker (HP) asks Simone Brunozzi (Amazon)</a> what the underlying technology for DynamoDB is. Simone says can't disclose. Brian says: "it's MySQL!!". Simone says: "can't disclose". Brian insists: "it's MySQL!!"</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? I will be very much surprised to learn that DynamoDB uses MySQL; it doesn't make sense to me. Why would Brian Aker say that though? Did he just mean to tease Simone or is there something I just don't get?<!--more--></p>
<p>(Yes, Brian?)</p>
<h4>Question #2</h4>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/keynote-state-mysql-ecosystem">Matt Aslett speaks about adoption of MySQL &amp; variants</a>, and expected adoption in next years, Mentions MariaDB, Percona Server, SkySQL. KEeps saying how the SkySQL server gets more traction.</blockquote>
<p>What does he mean? There's no SkySQL fork; does he mean SkySQL cloud offer? Or just SkySQL support services, typically for MariaDB variant? But in that case, SkySQL is out of context. What's going on?</p>
<h4>Question #3</h4>
<blockquote>Matt Aslett presents quite pessimistic prediction for MySQL. Reduced popularity in next years. Relatively good news for MontyProgram/MariaDB; otherwise a lot of switch-off to PostgreSQL, poor adoption for Continuent, low ratios of "evaluation" to "adoption" of technologies; really quite depressing. Later mentions at about <strong>200+</strong> questionnaires.</blockquote>
<p>I don't have a special interest here as I don't work for any mentioned company; other than my general desire to see the ecosystem flourishing.</p>
<p>Are <strong>200+</strong> people enough to both give a faithful picture of current MySQL usage and adoption? Are they enough for prediction <strong>1</strong> year into the future? <strong>4</strong> years into the future?</p>
<p>In Israel, with less than <strong>8M</strong> population, election surveys usually look at <strong>500+</strong> people. To me it doesn't sound a lot, but statistics is not my strong skill. However those picked for the survey have to be a diverse population, distributed in similar ratio to overall population (so Jews, Muslims, Christians, Orthodox, income level, geographic location, etc.).</p>
<p>Does the same happen with those <strong>200+</strong> questionnaires in the <a href="http://451research.com/">451 research</a>? The reason I ask is this: at the end of keynote Matt says: "if you want your voice to be heard, if you think differently, contact me, and I'll add you to our survey". Does this mean anyone stepping up is included? Great, so a hypothetical company called GalleriaDB would encourage its 50 employees to enlist, thereby completely shifting the balance.</p>
<p>Who are those <strong>200+</strong> people in the survey? World wide known experts? Your regular DBA? Your remote DBA consultant? Your web developer? Do they represent the overall MySQL ecosystem population? Do their insights into the future collide with those of everyone?</p>
