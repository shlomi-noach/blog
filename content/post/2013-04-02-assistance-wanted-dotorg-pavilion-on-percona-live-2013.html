<p>I'm looking for assistance in manning a DotOrg Pavilion on the upcoming <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">Percona Live conference</a> in Santa Clara.</p>
<p>As you may or may not know, free and open source projects are eligible to ask for a free booth on the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/exhibit-hall">Expo hall</a>. This is a good chance to promote one's project.</p>
<p>Of course, someone must stand behind the counter and answer [technical] questions.</p>
<p>I should like to have aÂ booth for <a href="https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a> &amp; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openarkkit/">openark-kit</a>, but am limited in resources -- namely the number of bodies I can occupy simultaneously, just one at this time. Along with some duties I have throughout the conference I do not expect to be able to be present for long periods behind the counter.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with <em>common_schema</em>/<em>openark-kit</em>? Would you like to lend a hand and contribute some hours at the conference?</p>
<p>For a full time attendee I can lend a hand and provide with a free conference pass + my gratitude.</p>
<p>Please comment below if you are willing to commit yourself to this task -- thank you!</p>
