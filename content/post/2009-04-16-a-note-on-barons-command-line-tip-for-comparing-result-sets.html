<p>A while ago <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/">Baron Schwartz</a> published a <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/03/25/mysql-command-line-tip-compare-result-sets/">MySQL command-line tip: compare result sets</a>.</p>
<p>A "<strong>SELECT * FROM world</strong>", for example, can be checksummed, compared with another checksum made on a replica, or otherwise another table which is supposed to contains the exact same data.</p>
<p>I just wanted to note that if you're dealing with a MyISAM table, a simple "<strong>SELECT * FROM</strong>" will not necessarily be too useful, since MyISAM can store rows in any particular order: two different settings of <strong>concurrent_insert</strong>, or perhaps an <strong>OPTIMIZE</strong>d table, can make for different ordering, hence different checksums.</p>
<p>Use of "<strong>ORDER BY ...</strong>" is required if you want to have a consistent checksum. With MyISAM, you don't usually want to count on natural row ordering, at any case.</p>
