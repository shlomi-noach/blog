<p>I first read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/0596101716">High Performance MySQL, 2nd edition</a> about a year ago, when it first came out. I since re-read a few pages on occasion.</p>
<p>In my previous posts I've suggested ways to improve upon the common ranking solution. Very innovative stuff! Or... so I thought.</p>
<p>I happened to browse through the book today, and a section on User Variables caught my eye. "<em>Let's see if I get get some insight</em>", I thought to myself. Imagine my surprise when I realized almost everything I've suggested is discussed in this modest section, black on white, sitting on my bookshelf for over a year!</p>
<p>I have read it a year back, have forgotten all about it, have re-invented stuff already solved and discussed... Oh, for more brain capacity...</p>
<p>To be honest, this has happened to me more than once in the past few months; I'm taking the habit of browsing the web when I'm looking for answers to my problems; I forget that this book contains the answers to so many common, practical MySQL problems, and does so in a very direct and helpful manner.</p>
<p>So, yet again, thumbs up to <em>High Performance MySQL</em>. Really a must book. Get it if you haven't already!</p>
