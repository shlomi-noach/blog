<p>Development, Middleware, [Oracle] Database, BI, ERP, CRM, SCM, EPM, SOA &amp; BPM, Java, Security -- all these and more are on the schedule. No MySQL track, not a single MySQL session.</p>
<p>Lack of speakers? Hardly. Lack of public interest? I can't imagine.</p>
<p>Then what is it? I have no information, and don't want to throw around suggestions.</p>
<p>Reading the convention's objectives, I see nothing to suggest why MySQL would not be in. Heck, there's even two new special seminars: "<em>Family Economy</em>" and "<em>Career planning</em>".</p>
<p>Sorry, not providing a link this time (besides, it's all Hebrew). If you're eager to look it up, google for "Oracle week Israel".</p>
<p>It's a shame, and makes it harder to answer the <em>"so what do you think Oracle will do to MySQL?"</em> question I get to be asked ever so often.</p>
