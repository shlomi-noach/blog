<div>
<p>Another new year by Jewish calendar. What do I wish for the following year?</p>
<ol>
<li>World peace</li>
<li>Good health to all</li>
<li>Multi-core execution for queries</li>
</ol>
<p>After having evaluated a few columnar databases, and having seen how a single query gets 24 cores busy, I can't look at MySQL the same way again. The fact that a single query consumes a single core only doesn't seem right in the year 2014. <a href="https://github.com/greenlion/swanhart-tools/tree/master/shard-query">Shard-query</a> is a cool application-level attempt to solve the above; I would like to see stuff like this implemented inside the server (or inside the storage engine where possible).</p>
<p>None of my wishes in previous years [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year">2010</a>], [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year-2">2011</a>], [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year-201">2012</a>], [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wished-for-a-new-year-2013">2013</a>] came true (and mostly gone worse). I'm still willing to settle for two out of three.</p>
