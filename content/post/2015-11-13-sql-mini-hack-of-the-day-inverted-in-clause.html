title: SQL mini hack of the day, inverted IN clause

<p>We are used to issue queries with an <strong>IN</strong> clause of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><pre>... where state in ('started', 'completed', 'failed') ...</pre></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However I've had a few cases where I used an inverted format. Here's one use case followed by an inverted <strong>IN</strong> clause.</p>
<h3>Dynamic query building</h3>
<p>Say we have this function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[code lang="golang"]GetLaggingSlaves(clusterName string)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Which, based on whether given <strong>clusterName</strong> is empty or not, would return list of all lagging slaves, or only those in the given cluster, respectively:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT hostname FROM database_instance WHERE slave_lag_seconds &gt; 60</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT hostname FROM database_instance WHERE cluster_name = 'mycluster:3306' AND slave_lag_seconds &gt; 60</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid SQL injection you would create a prepared statement, but you don't want to copy+paste everything, and so you build your query dynamically based on the value of <strong>clusterName</strong>. You want to end up with either:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT hostname FROM database_instance WHERE slave_lag_seconds &gt; ?</pre>
<p><strong>, acceptableLag</strong></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT hostname FROM database_instance WHERE cluster_name = ? AND slave_lag_seconds &gt; ?</pre>
<p><strong>, clusterName, acceptableLag</strong></blockquote>
<p>Dynamic query building is good practice, but a little pain (BTW I'm designing a new, simple &amp; non intrusive query builder for golang). Is there a way to just get away with one query that has it all?</p>
<p>This is one option:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT hostname FROM database_instance WHERE (cluster_name = ? OR ? = '') AND slave_lag_seconds &gt; ?</pre>
<p><strong>,clusterName, clusterName, acceptableLag</strong></blockquote>
<p>and it is somewhat painful to list clusterName twice in the arguments list. This is where the inverted <strong>IN</strong> clause kicks in. It will negate usage of an index, and may look strange at first glance, but as you get used to it it just becomesÂ another pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT hostname FROM database_instance WHERE ? IN (cluster_name, '') AND slave_lag_seconds &gt; ?</pre>
<p><strong>, clusterName, acceptableLag</strong></blockquote>
<p>So when <strong>clusterName</strong> is empty, all rows where <strong>slave_lag_seconds &gt; acceptableLag</strong> are fetched; when non empty, only those where <strong>cluster_name</strong> equals our value.</p>
