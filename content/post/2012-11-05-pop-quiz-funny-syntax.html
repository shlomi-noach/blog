<p>The following questions are of little importance, yet I find them entertaining. I stumbled upon these while developing QueryScript.</p>
<p>Can you guess the results of the following statements?</p>
<h4>Pop quiz 1</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>SET @x := 7;
SELECT ++@x;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the computation result? What will be the value of <strong>@x</strong>?</p>
<h4>Pop quiz 2</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>SET @ := 4;
SELECT @ + @'' + @``</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the computation result?</p>
<h4>Pop quiz 3</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>SET @a := 2;
SELECT @a = @'a' = @`a`</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Do we get <strong>TRUE</strong> or <strong>FALSE</strong>? When?<!--more--></p>
<h4>Hints</h4>
<p>Consider the following queries as hints to the above questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT +++++-@x;
SELECT @ = @'', @ = @``
SELECT (@a = @'a') = @`a`</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Answers</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pop quiz 1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>++@x</strong> is interpreted as <strong>+(+(@x))</strong>, which is in turn evaluated as <strong>0+(0+(@x))</strong>. No relation to <strong>C</strong>'s <strong>++</strong> operator. <strong>@x</strong> is unchanged.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pop quiz 2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>@x</strong> is the same as <strong>@'x'</strong> and as <strong>@`x`</strong>. What's funny is that one is allowed to create the empty-named user defined variable <strong>@''</strong>. Makes for a weird looking syntax, but nothing special about it. Computation result is <strong>12</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pop quiz 3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We've already established that <strong>@a</strong>, <strong>@'a'</strong> and <strong>@`a`</strong> are the same, I just used this notation for adding pepper to the quiz. The real question is whether <strong>2 = 2 = 2</strong> holds true.Â  It does not. There is no 3-way comparison. All comparisons are in pairs, which is why the expression evaluates as <strong>(2 = 2) = 2</strong>, leading to <strong>1 = 2</strong>, <strong>"1"</strong> being the <strong>TRUE</strong> value of <strong>(2 = 2)</strong>. The only value of <strong>@a</strong> for which the expression holds true is <strong>1</strong>.</p>
