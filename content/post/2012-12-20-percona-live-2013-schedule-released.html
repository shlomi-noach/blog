<p>I'm happy to report the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/program/schedule/sessions-day-1">release of the program schedule</a> for the next Percona Live event, April <strong>2013</strong>.</p>
<p>While you can see there are still some "TODO"s, and minor scheduling changes still to go, the overall reviewing process is complete, and the schedule is sound.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/conference-committee">committee</a> has reviewed over <strong>250</strong> submissions in total, sessions and tutorials. It took two months to review the sessions and finalize the schedule. There were very good submissions, and it wasn't till I started building the schedule that I realized just how many.</p>
<p>You know the feeling: you're at a conference, and there's this time slot where you just can't make up your mind which session to attend. As it turns out, anyway I look at it, I get this at each and every single time slot in this schedule. Hopefully all attendees should feel similarly.</p>
<h4>What can you expect to find in the Santa Clara, April conference?</h4>
<p>As always, we get variety of topics. First day is tutorials, which I already <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/percona-live-2013-tutorials-schedule-released">mentioned</a>, followed by three days of sessions and keynotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some topics you can guess: always place for good backup practice, performance optimizations for your InnoDB deployment, good indexing strategies and more.</li>
<li>Open source and emerging technologies are well covered: from Tungsten, Galera/Percona XtraDB Cluster, NDB Cluster to MHA, HAProxy, Hadoop, Percona Toolkit and more.</li>
<li>MariaDB has good coverage, as well as Percona Server.</li>
<li>Scale topics such as sharding, building large deployments,Big Data.</li>
<li>Cloud is well represented, too. Deployments on Amazon, Google Cloud, OpenStack, SkySQL Cloud Data Suite; interesting content on virtualization.</li>
<li>Optimizer, better queries, query evaluation plans.</li>
<li>Replication, of course, is as always a hot topic, this year in particular due to anticipated 5.6 release</li>
<li>Speaking of 5.6, a lot of content on that, too. PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA, InnoDB, partitions, GIS and more...</li>
<li>Case studies: can you do without them? Get to hear how big companies used product/project X, what it took to make it work, how it helped them grow.</li>
<li>Chance to get up to speed on third party solutions: Akiban, Tokutek, ScaleDB...</li>
<li>Hardware: SSDs are all the rage. How do you nest choose and configure your hardware and deployment?</li>
<li>Best practices, security, monitoring, NoSQL...</li>
<li>And, I can't list everything, but a LOT of good, unique content!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will write some more on specific sessions I find that are of unique interest.</p>
<p>Finally, this is my first time acting as committee chairman, and so much of this work was new to me, and I got to learn it on the fly. Thankfully, the committee is composed of experienced conference veterans, not to mention experts, who gave good advice. I was happy to ask for their advice and happy to accept. I wish to thank the committee members for their kindness and openness! (That doesn't mean I'm buying you all your beer though!)</p>
