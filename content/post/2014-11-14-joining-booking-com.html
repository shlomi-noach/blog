<p>I'm excited to be joining <a href="https://workingatbooking.com/">Booking.com</a> at the Netherlands in a couple weeks :)</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to be working with a great team and friendly people! I hope to contribute from my experience and of course be challenged by difficult problems.</p>
<p><em>Booking.com</em> is a supporter of open source in multiple aspects, and I am looking forward to continue working with open source solutions as well as releasing open source code.</p>
<p>I am leaving my work at <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/">Outbrain</a> feeling grateful for the opportunity of working at this wonderful company! I am awed and humbled by the amazing teams I've worked with, whose level of knowledge and insights I can only aspire to match. Thank you in particular to the Infrastructure team, of which I was proud to be part of.</p>
<p>Outbrain allowed me and others (and in fact encouraged and supported) to develop as much <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/">open source</a> as we saw fit. This is not a minor thing: when you orient your code towards open source, you need to make generalizations which are not always providing direct benefit to the company, and which consume precious time. I hold Outbrain in the highest respect for their support for open source.</p>
