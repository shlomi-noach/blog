<p>Are you attending PerconaLive?</p>
<p>Allow me to suggest you attend the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/common-schema-framework-mysql-server-administration">Common Schema: a framework for MySQL server administration</a> session on <strong></strong>April <strong>12</strong>, <strong>14:00 - 14:50</strong> @ Ballroom F.</p>
<p>This talk is by none other than <a href="http://rpbouman.blogspot.com/">Roland Bouman</a>. Roland co-authored parts of <em>common_schema</em>, and is a great speaker.</p>
<p>I have a personal interest, of course, being the author of most of the components in <em>common_schema</em>. I would like to convert you to a supporter of this project. I know a few very smart people who think this project is an important tool. I would like more people to get to know it. Eventually, I would like developers and DBAs alike to consider it an inseparable part of any MySQL installation.</p>
<p>Then I shall have world domination, Bwa ha ha!</p>
<p>PS,</p>
<p>Have fun, I will unfortunately not attend myself this year. Having been on the program committee, I can tell it's going to be a great conference!</p>
