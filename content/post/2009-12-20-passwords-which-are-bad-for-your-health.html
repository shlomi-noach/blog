<p>I've seen some passwords to take a few years from my life.</p>
<p>I mean, we all know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack">dictionary words</a>, right? And we've all seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/">Spaceballs</a>, right? But choosing <strong>12345</strong> as your password is not the only careless option: there are many more! The more I get familiar with user's password, the more I see how so much alike they all are.</p>
<p>Let's review some of the commonly used bad password practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empty passwords. Need I say more? Apparently yes. So what if <em>"there's only access through firewall from our company's IP"</em>?</li>
<li>Dictionary passwords: real English words like '<strong>falcon</strong>' or '<strong>tiger</strong>'. Don't use these! These are the easiest to attack.</li>
<li>Well known words: how about '<strong>Gandalf</strong>'? It's not dictionary, but it's popular enough to appear in any respectable list. For that matter, look at how well filtered passwords are on RedHat: you can't choose a password which is a common first or last name in the US, Italy, or even Israel; which is great!</li>
<li>Common substitues: enough with '<strong>1nsi9ht</strong>' and '<strong>@dm1n</strong>'! These are almost as easy to break as dictionary words; it's just a matter of a few more combinations per word.</li>
<li>Keyboard clustered: say <em>No!</em> to '<strong>1qa2ws</strong>'. Don't use '<strong>$rty&amp;*io</strong>'. They seems to be random at first sight, but look for them on the keyboard: it's just your common <em>"how shall I create a password that's so easy to remember I will never forget it?"</em>. Now <strong>REPLACE("remember", "break")</strong> and <strong>REPLACE("never forget", "always regret")</strong>.</li>
<li>Children's names, birth dates, <strong>123456</strong>, your car's license plate number, your <em>Yahoo!</em> mail password, etc. etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many guidelines for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Guidelines_for_strong_passwords">choosing strong passwords</a>. And everyone seems to know about it. But I'm still surprised when I find out the MySQL root password is '<strong>zxcvbn</strong>' or '<strong>pa55wd</strong>'.</p>
<p>MySQL allows for any character in your password, so you may use punctuations, spaces, and other symbols. This is stronger than plain characters and digits.</p>
<p><!--more-->I think it all boils down to one question: do you really need to <em>remember</em> the password? If so, go ahead and use some personal hints, and make it difficult for the intruder.</p>
<p>If not - and you can store the passwords, encrypted by stronger passwords on a secure server; on plain paper on your bookshelf; behind your mother's cupboard, embedded between her Bridge winnings notes - then use as strong a password as you can get.</p>
<p>A good tool which I've begun to use recently is <strong>pwgen</strong>. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$ pwgen -cn 32 1
na5thoeh4jaeth9OoMooBiosoophuShi
$ pwgen -ycn 32 1
zahC0eehei.tee0pahL3sej2ohv^e8me</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>pwgen</strong> can be instructed to produce or not to produce digits, uppercase letters, special characters, and is very handy.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Not all my passwords are so strong; I make the distinction between critical data, confidential data, personal data; the damage done by exposing a password; etc.</p>
<p>If your server is behind firewall, that means you have a reason for not letting people in. Take the next small step and choose strong passwords for your OS, database, htaccess and the rest of the gang.</p>
