title: MySQL parameters & configuration sample file
type: post

<p>The following is a sample my.cnf configuration file. It includes some common and uncommon parameters, along with occasional comments.</p>
<p>You can use this file, and tune as appropriate for your machine, operating system, and application needs.</p>
<p>In particular, note the high values set for the InnoDB related parameters, below, and change them to match your system and application's requirements. You have been warned.<!--more--></p>

# The following location is not the default location for many<br />
# pre-packaged utilities. For example, mytop or mysqlreport<br />
# (or any Perl or Python based client, for that matter), will<br />
# NOT look in the /tmp path for the mysql.sock file.<br />
