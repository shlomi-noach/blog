<p>In less than a month I'll be giving these two talks at <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/">Percona Live</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">common_schema: DBA's framework for MySQL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still unfamiliar with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema,</a> this will make for a good introduction. I'll give you multiple reasons why you would want to use it, and how it would come to <em>immediate</em> use at your company. I do mean <em>immediate</em>, as in previous <em>common_schema</em> presentations I happened to get feedback emails from attendees within the same or next day letting me know how <em>common_schema</em> solved an insistent problem of theirs or how it exposed an unknown status.</p>
<p>I'll review some useful views &amp; routines, and discuss the ease and power of QueryScript. <em>common_schema</em> is a Swiss-knife of solutions, and all from within your MySQL server.</p>
<p>I am using <em>common_schema</em> in production on a regular basis, and it happened to be hero of the day in multiple occasions. I'll present a couple such cases.</p>
<p>http://www.slideshare.net/shlominoach/commonschema-22-dbas-framework-for-mysql</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/mysql-devops-outbrain">MySQL DevOps @ Outbrain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a technical talk touching at some cultural issues.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/about/what-is-outbrain">Outbrain</a>, where I work, we have two blessings: a large group of engineers and a large dataset. We at the infrastructure team, together with the ops team, are responsible for the availability of the data. What we really like is technology which lets the owners of a problem be able to recognize it and take care of it. We want ops guys to do ops, and engineers to do engineering. And we want them to be able to talk to each other and <em>understand</em> each other.</p>
<p>What tools can you use to increase visibility? To allow sharing of data between the teams? I'll share some tools and techniques that allow us to automate deployments, detect a malfunctioning/abusing service, deploy schema changes across dozens of hosts, control data retention, monitor connections, and more.</p>
<p>We like open source. The tools discussed are mostly open source, or open sourced by Outbrain.</p>
<p>I'll explain why these tools matter, and how they serve the purpose of removing friction between teams, allowing for quick analysis of problems and overall visibility on all things that happen.</p>
