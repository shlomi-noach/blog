<p>Unless specified otherwise, <strong>latin1</strong> is the default character set in MySQL.</p>
<p>What I usually find in schemes are columns which are either <strong>utf8</strong> or <strong>latin1</strong>. The <strong>utf8</strong> columns being those which need to contain multilingual characters (user names, addresses, articles etc.), and <strong>latin1</strong> column being all the rest (passwords, digests, email addresses, hard-coded values etc.)</p>
<p>I find <strong>latin1</strong> to be improper for such purposes and suggest that <strong>ascii</strong> be used instead. The reason being that <strong>latin1</strong> implies a European text (with swedish collation). It is unclear for an outsider, when finding a <strong>latin1</strong> column, whether it should actually contain West European characters, or is it just being used for ascii text, utilizing the fact that a character in <strong>latin1</strong> only requires 1 byte of storage.<!--more--></p>
<p>Well, this is what the <strong>ascii</strong> character set is for. When I see an <strong>ascii</strong> column, I know for sure no West European characters are allowed; just the plain old a-zA-Z0-9 etc. It is clearer from the schema's definition what the stored values should be.</p>
<h4>A note to MySQL</h4>
<p>It's been long since the Swedish roots of the company have dictated defaults. New instances should default to either <strong>ascii</strong> orÂ  <strong>utf8</strong> (the latter being the most common and space efficient unicode protocol): character sets that are locale-neutral. Really, how many people realize that when they <strong>ORDER BY</strong> a text column, rows are sorted according to Swedish dictionary ordering?</p>
