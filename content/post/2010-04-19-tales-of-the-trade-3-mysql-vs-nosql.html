<p>Apparently the message from the comic below was not well conceived.</p>
<p>Following the strip I've added some spoiler notes.<br />
<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tales-of-the-trade-mysql-vs-nosql.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2335" title="tales-of-the-trade-mysql-vs-nosql" src="/blog/assets/tales-of-the-trade-mysql-vs-nosql.png" alt="" width="580" height="2224" /></a></p>
<p>This is not about bashing NoSQL. Apparently some people feel this way.</p>
<p>This is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to judge/analyze NoSQL as if it were a single entity, thereby asking "should I use MySQL or NoSQL"?</li>
<li>The fact Wikipedia defines NoSQL as a "movement" (who's the leader?)</li>
<li>The fact that people are still arguing on how "MySQL" should be pronounced.</li>
</ul>
