<p><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">Percona Live 2013</a> is shortly upon us, and it might be a good idea to watch for what's ahead of us.</p>
<h4>Talks of interest</h4>
<p>There is no way I can do justice to all. I wish to point out a <em>small</em> number of sessions I am personally interested in attending. I will not be able to attend them all, since there are too many sessions of interest and too few instances of myself (merely one).</p>
<p>I've tried to list some talks which are not absolutely obvious (when Peter Zaitsev speaks of MySQL performance, or Monty speaks about MariaDB, or Robert Hodges or Domas speak about replication -- well -- you're certain to have the ins and outs, right?). I can also expect Galera or Percona XtraDB Cluster talks to attract a lot of attention. There is a lot of good content for each.</p>
<p>But I was happy to find some very special talks this year, which are not the "every conference has got to have one talk about this" type. Here's a hybrid collection of both types.</p>
<p>After constructing the list I've intentionally dropped two random sessions. If you are speaking, and not mentioned here, your talk must be one of those two!<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-and-virtualization">MySQL and Virtualization</a> (Raghavendra Prabhu): I have family ties with KVM. But seriously, a talk which describes the in-depth relationship between KVM and MySQL instances, how to do instrumentation... I'm very interested!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-query-anti-patterns-can-be-moved-sphinx">MySQL Query Anti-Patterns that can be moved to Sphinx</a> (Vladimir Fedorkov): Sphinx can be so much more than just fulltext search. You can throw full blown queries onto your sphinx server, and it can sometimes help you avoid complex table design. I expect this talk to deliver a lot of info about how to do so. As not too many people are intimately familiar with Sphinx, this should be a very good off-your-balance kind of talk when you realize the things you could do with this mature technology.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-cluster-when-use-it-and-when-not">MySQL Cluster - When to use it and when not to</a> (Max Mether): I don't have too much experience with NDB Cluster; and what experience I've had is a few years old. I'm happy to learn when NDB is just not for you -- I like the idea of setting up the perimeters first, before embarking on a technology.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/using-percona-toolkit-detect-and-even-prevent-sql-injection-attacks">Using the Percona Toolkit to detect and even prevent SQL injection attacks</a> (Justin Swanhart): an unusual talk. I'm totally curios to hear this. Be on the watch for Justin's other talks: quite extraordinary abstracts!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/mysql-administration-amazon-rds">MySQL administration in Amazon RDS</a> (Ben Black): How many are using RDS? I used it for a short time, and can't say I had chance to utilize its advantages or get bit by its downsides. Next time I use it, I'd like to be better prepared.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/practical-failover-design-automated-semi-automated-and-manual-failover">Practical failover design - automated, semi-automated and manual failover</a> (Yoshinori Matsunobu): failover scenarios and solutions -- nothing much to add!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/ricks-rots-rules-thumb">Rick's RoTs (Rules of Thumb)</a> (Rick James): good advice on common SQL practice; should be very valuable for developers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/introduction-sharding-jetpants">Introduction to Sharding with Jetpants</a> (Evan Elias): oh I have to see this one. Open source sharding solution? Cloning slaves? Rebalancing shards? Just read the abstract; it is <em>very</em> promising.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/reddwarf-database-service-openstack-project">Reddwarf: Database as a Service Openstack project</a> (Patrick Galbraith): have to see this one as well! Oh, darn, two "must see" talks on same time slot! (I actually have this <em>on every time slot</em> this year). Also note Mark Atwood's talk about RedDwarf, and Patrick's talk about Chef.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will probably construct another list for the more obvious talks. Stay tuned!</p>
<h4>Trivia: win a free pass</h4>
<p>Glad you made it thus far: the first to answer correctly <em>and</em> most comprehensively is to receive a <em>free full conference pass</em>, courtesy Percona.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to ask "what's in my pocket?". But he answer must be related to MySQL and I don't carry RDBMS on me, so I'll go with:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Who will open your present,</em></p>
<p><em>Make you play pleasant,</em></p>
<p><em>Tidy your mess,</em></p>
<p><em>Do the same for all else?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Be gentle with me, I'm not a professional riddler and English isn't may main language. I'm not sure if this riddle is ridiculously easy or impractical to answer -- so let's consider this as my first attempt as a rhymer.</p>
<p>If you would benefit from a free ticket -- please use the comments below! <strong>Note</strong>: <em>comments will be hidden for a few hours</em>.</p>
<p>If you only wish to play for the fun of it (maybe you already have a ticket) - just email me at <em>shlomi@[you-know-where-or-just-look-at-the-url-for-this-post].org</em>; I'll let you know if you are correct, and perhaps publish in comments at a later stage.</p>
