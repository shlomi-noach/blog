title: 'MySQL Community Awards 2015: Call for Nominations!'

<p>The <strong>2015</strong> MySQL Community Awards event will take place, as usual, in Santa Clara, during the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo, April 2015.</p>
<p>The MySQL Community Awards is a community based initiative. The idea is to publicly recognize contributors to the MySQL ecosystem. The entire process of discussing, voting and awarding is controlled by an independent group of community members, typically based of past winners or their representatives, as well as known contributors.</p>
<p>It is a self-appointed, self-declared, self-making-up-the-rules-as-it-goes committee. It is also very aware of the importance of the community; a no-nonsense, non-political, adhering to tradition, self criticizing committee.</p>
<p>The Call for Nominations is open. We are seeking the community’s assistance in nominating candidates in the following categories:<!--more--></p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2015</h4>
<p>This is a personal award; a winner would a person who has made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This could be via development, advocating, blogging, speaking, supporting, etc. All things go.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2015</h4>
<p>An application, project, product etc. which supports the MySQL ecosystem by either contributing code, complementing its behaviour, supporting its use, etc. This could range from a one man open source project to a large scale social service.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2015</h4>
<p>A company who made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This might be a corporate which released major open source code; one that advocates for MySQL; one that help out community members by... anything.</p>
<p>For a list of previous winners, please see <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2012/february/mysql-hall-fame">MySQL Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<h4>Process of nomination and voting</h4>
<p>Anyone can nominate anyone. When nominating, please make sure to provide a brief explanation on why the candidate is eligible to get the award. Make a good case!</p>
<p>The committee will review all nominations and vote; it typically takes two rounds of votes to pick the winners, and a lot of discussion.</p>
