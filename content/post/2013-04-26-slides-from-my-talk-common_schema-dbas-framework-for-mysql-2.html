<p>I've just uploaded the slides from my talk:Â <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">common_schema: DBA's framework for MySQL</a></p>
<p>My talk was well attended, and I was fortunate to have a warm and engaged audience. Thank you to all those who attended, and thank you for those who provided feedback! Was happy to be able to present my work a great group of people.</p>
<p>You can find my slide either on <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">Percona Live's website</a>, or on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/shlominoach/commonschema-20-dbas-framework-for-mysql">Slideshare</a>, as well as embedded right here.</p>
<p>I set two aims to my talk:</p>
<ol>
<li>To have the audience know how to download and install <a href="https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a> (<em>Check!</em>)</li>
<li>Have everyone in the audience find <strong>one</strong> tool from <em>common_schema</em> that will make their day better. Quick raise of hands at the end of presentation: <em>Check!</em> All hands are up!</li>
</ol>
<p>As I've noted following a question, <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/rdebug.html">rdebug</a> is still in alpha. It modifies one's routines in such way that does not alter the routine's behavior, <em>except</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affecting the value returned by <strong>ROW_COUNT()</strong> (I have no immediate solution to that)</li>
<li>Also affecting result of <strong>LAST_INSERT_ID()</strong> (I expect to have this solved).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you again; give <em>common_schema</em> a try. Best ways to support: submit bug reports, ideas, and above all: spread the word. <em>common_schema for world domination!</em></p>
