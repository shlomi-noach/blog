<p>I will be speaking at August Penguin 2011 (<a href="http://www.hamakor.org.il/2011/07/08/%D7%94%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98-%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9F-2011/">אוגוסט פינגווין</a>), on August 12th in Ramat-Gan, Israel.</p>
<p><em>August Penguin</em> is the annual meeting of <a href="http://www.hamakor.org.il/en/">Hamakor</a> society: an Israeli society for Free Software and Open-Source Code (read more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamakor">here</a>).</p>
<p>I'll be holding a non-technical talk about MySQL, titled <em>"MySQL and the Open Source Sphere"</em>.  In this talk I will be presenting my impressions of the nature of open  source development of MySQL and surroundings: the core server, the  various forks, patches, 3rd party tools, companies involved, etc. So  this is a general "get to know who's who &amp; what's what in the MySQL  world".</p>
<p>This is a 30 minutes talk. I will surely not cover every open source  development in this field, so my apologies in advance to those I leave  out. The truth is, there's so much going on lately I can hardly keep up  with reading the announcements. Truly, this is a wonderful time for open  source development with MySQL.</p>
<p>Talk will be held in Hebrew.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
