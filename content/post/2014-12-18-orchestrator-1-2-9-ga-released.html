<p><a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">Orchestrator</a> <strong>1.2.9 GA</strong> <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator/releases/tag/v1.2.9">has been released</a>. Noteworthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added "<strong>ReadOnly</strong>" (true/false) configuration param. You can have orchestrator completely read-only</li>
<li>Added <strong>"AuthenticationMethod": "multi"</strong>: works like BasicAuth (your normal HTTP user+password) only it also accepts the special user called <strong>"readonly"</strong>, which, surprise, can only view and not modify</li>
<li>Centralized/serialized most backend database writes (with hundreds/thousands monitored servers it was possible or probable that high concurrency led to too-many-connections openned on the backend database).</li>
<li>Fixed evil evil bug that would skip some checks if binary logs were not enabled</li>
<li>Better hostname resolve (now also asking MySQL server to resolve hostname; resolving is cached)</li>
<li><strong>Pseudo-GTID</strong> (read <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/refactoring-replication-topology-with-pseudo-gtid">here</a>, <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/orchestrator-1-2-1-beta-pseudo-gtid-support-reconnect-slaves-even-after-master-failure">here</a>, <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/refactoring-replication-topologies-with-pseudo-gtid-a-visual-tour">here</a>) support now considered stable (apart from being tested it has already been put to practice multiple times in production at <strong>Outbrain</strong>, in different planned and unplanned crash scenarios)</li>
</ul>
<p>I continue developing <em>orchestrator</em> as free and open source at my new employer, <a href="http://www.booking.com">Booking.com</a>.</p>
