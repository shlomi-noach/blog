<p>Here are the slides from my talk <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/session/programmatic-queries-things-you-can-code-with-sql/">Programmatic Queries: things you can code with SQL</a> held on October 25th on the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/">Percona Live</a> event, London.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/programmatic_queries__things_you_can_code_with_sql.pdf">Programmatic Queries: PDF</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I wish to thank those who attended my talk.</p>
<p>The topic of the talk was irregular and, to some extent, controversial. Should one really rely on internal implementation for optimizing her queries? <em>Sergei Golubchik</em> was quick to suggest that even in current and coming versions of MariaDB, some things I spoke about may not hold true. I accept.</p>
<p>I was in urge to complete my talk within the time frame. I was happy to hear later on that my talk was well received.</p>
<p>There were homework to my talk. I thought I would make some contest picking the best answers, stay tuned.</p>
