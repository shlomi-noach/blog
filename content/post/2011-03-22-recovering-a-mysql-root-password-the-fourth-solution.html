<p>Have just read Darren Cassar's <a title="Permanent Link to Recovering a MySQL `root` password – Three solutions" rel="bookmark" href="http://mysqlpreacher.com/wordpress/2011/03/recovering-a-mysql-root-password-three-solutions/">Recovering a MySQL `root` password – Three solutions</a>. There's a fourth solution: using an <strong>init-file</strong>, which leads to just one restart of the database instead of two. It also avoids the security issue involved with using <strong>skip-grant-tables</strong>.</p>
<p>I've written all about it before on <a title="Permanent Link to Dangers of skip-grant-tables" rel="bookmark" href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/dangers-of-skip-grant-tables">Dangers of skip-grant-tables</a>.</p>
<p>Darren's 1st advice (look for password ini files, scripts, etc.) is a very good one. One password that can always be looked up in files is the replication's password.</p>
<p>Replication's password is easily forgotten: you only set it once and never use it again; never script it nor manually login with. When setting up new slaves, though, you suddenly need it.</p>
<p>Apparently not many realize that the replication password is written in plaintext in the <strong>master.info</strong> file. This file tells the slave all about it's master connection: host, port, user &amp; password are all there for you to read.</p>
