<p>The complete tutorial &amp; session schedule for <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/">Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014</a> is released. This schedule offers both a sense of achievement as well as a sense of regret; for I believe the schedule is very good, and yet some good proposals had to be left out.</p>
<p>This is an inevitable result of a conference that is popular and receives far more proposals than can fit within the time frames. This conference offers <strong>96</strong> session slots and <strong>16</strong> 3-hour tutorial slots. We got well over <strong>300</strong> proposals -- I'm not even sure how to count them -- and they just can't all fit in. My sincere apologies to all those left out. A proposal of mine was just rejected yesterday from another conference; I can sympathize and empathize with all turned down.</p>
<p>As part of our interest in having a diversity of talks and speakers, we have promoted talks by less frequent speakers and newly presenting companies. We are happy to grow the community!</p>
<p>Although titled "Percona Live", this conference's program is managed by a diverse and independent committee. We had good discussions and some very good thinking and advice were offered. I'm happy to acknowledge and thank the committee members:</p>
<ul>
<li>CÃ©dric Peintre, Dailymotion</li>
<li>Giuseppe Maxia, Continuent</li>
<li>Ivan Zoratti, SkySQL</li>
<li>Jay Janssen, Percona</li>
<li>Jeremy Cole, Google</li>
<li>Laine Campbell, PalominoDB (now Blackbird, congrats!)</li>
<li>Liz van Dijk, Percona</li>
<li>Roland Bouman, Pentaho</li>
<li>Tim Callaghan, Tokutek</li>
<li>Todd Farmer, Oracle</li>
<li>myself, Outbrain</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the schedule I'm as always eager to attend many more sessions than I can; until I get more replicas of myself, It's again down to choosing between multiple prominent talks at each time slot.</p>
<p>Thank you to all those who submitted a proposal! (It's cool, just saying)</p>
<h4>Birds of a Feather, Lightning Talks</h4>
<p>Call for papers continues! You are encouraged to <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/user">submit your proposals</a> until end of January. These proposals are reviewed by the committee, and eventually chosen and scheduled by Giuseppe Maxia. See also:</p>
