<p><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/conference-committee">Committee</a>'s reviewing process for session proposals for Percona Live 2013 conference is now complete. It is now time for scheduling, checking, double checking, organizing, categorizing and publishing the session schedule. This will take some time. However, we've put together a list of <strong>10</strong> sessions already approved.</p>
<p>Now, just building a list of 10 sessions is quite the task: the sessions must be rated high, present a broad range of topics, target audience, speakers... This list is not necessarily "the top <strong>10</strong> sessions you will ever see in the conference", but rather "a list of <strong>10</strong> great sessions you might want to see in the conference".</p>
<p>After all, any single attendee cannot see all possible sessions; but we sure want the attendee to have a great selection of talks!</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/program/sessions">10 approved sessions for the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2013</a>.</p>
