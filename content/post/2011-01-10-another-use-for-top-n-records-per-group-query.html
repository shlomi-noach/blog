title: Another use for "top N records per group" query
type: post
url: /mysql/another-use-for-top-n-records-per-group-query/
---

<p>A few days ago I published <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/sql-selecting-top-n-records-per-group">SQL: selecting top N records per group</a>. It just dawned on me that the very same query solved another type of problem I was having a couple years ago.</p>
<blockquote>BTW, for reference, Baron Schwartz posted <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/12/07/how-to-select-the-firstleastmax-row-per-group-in-sql/">this</a> 4 years ago. There are very interesting approaches in text and in comments. Good to see the ancients already knew of such problems, I should study my history better.</p>
<p>(Kidding, kidding! This is self criticism of course)</blockquote>
<p>In this case I present now I have a table with recurring data, which, to some extent, represents revision of data. For the sake of simplicity let's describe it as a simple simulation of a revision system:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have text files, whose content I store within a row</li>
<li>Each text file uses at least one row in the table</li>
<li>Text files can be edited, whereas an edited file is written in a new row (never UPDATEd).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold your horses: I'm not really implementing a revision system, I just can't get into the actual details here.</p>
<p>The table becomes large quickly, and it's desired to purge rows from the table. The rule is: we must obtain the most recent two versions for each file (if there are indeed more than one). All others can be purged. So the question is:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>Which are all the 3rd newest, 4th newst, ..., older, ..., oldest revisions per file?</blockquote>
<p>To use the example from the aforementioned post:</p>
<blockquote>Which are the 3rd largest, 4th largest, ..., smallest countries in each continent?</blockquote>
<p>Assuming <strong>group_concat_max_len</strong> allows, and enough numbers are available, all we need to do is change this condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>WHERE
  tinyint_asc.value &gt;= 1 AND tinyint_asc.value &lt;= 5
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>into:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>WHERE
  tinyint_asc.value &gt;= 3
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>More memory, more CPU</h4>
<p>The original query limited the number of resulting rows (only 5 per group). There's no such limitation now; there could be <strong>1,000</strong> revision per file, there could be more. So this latest query could incur more overhead. Back to the original problem, if I do the purging frequently enough, this shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Right. Now to the task of revisiting old, forgotten code :)</p>
