title: Those oversized, undersized variables defaults

<p>Some <strong>mysqld</strong> parameters are far from having reasonable defaults. Most notable are the engine-specific values, and in particular the InnoDB parameters.</p>
<p>Some of these variables have different defaults as of MySQL 5.4. <strong>innodb_buffer_pool_size</strong>, for example, is <strong>128M</strong> on 5.4. <strong>innodb_log_file_size</strong>, however, has changed back and forth, as far as I understand, and is down to <strong>5M</strong> again. These settings are still the same on 5.5.</p>
<p>I wish to present some not-so-obvious parameters which, in my opinion, have poor defaults, for reasons I will explain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>group_concat_max_len</strong>: This parameter limits the maximum text length of a <strong>GROUP_CONCAT</strong> concatenation result. It defaults to <strong>1024</strong>. I think this is a very low value. I have been using <strong>GROUP_CONCAT</strong> more and more, recently, to solve otherwise difficult problems. And in most cases, <strong>1024</strong> was just too low, resulting in <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/but-i-do-want-mysql-to-say-error">silent</a> (<em>Argh!</em>) truncating of the result, thus returning incorrect results. It is interesting to learn that the maximum value for this parameter is limited by <strong>max_packet_size</strong>. I would suggest, then, that this parameter should be altogether removed, and have the <strong>max_packet_size</strong> limitation as the only limitation. Otherwise, I'd like it to have a very large default value, in the order of a few MB.</li>
<li><strong>wait_timeout</strong>: Here's a parameter whose default value is over permissive. <strong>wait_timeout</strong> enjoys an <strong>8 hour</strong> default. I usually go for <strong>5-10 minutes</strong>. I don't see a point in letting idle connections waste resources for 8 hours. Applications which hold up such connections should be aware that they're doing something wrong, in the form of a forced disconnection. Connection pools work beautifully with low settings, and can themselves do keepalives, if they choose to.</li>
<li><strong>sql_mode</strong>: I've <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/do-we-need-sql_mode">discussed this</a> in length before. My opinion unchanged.</li>
<li><strong>open_files_limit</strong>: What with the fact connections, threads, table descriptors, table file descriptors (depending on how you use InnoDB), temporary file tables -- all are files on unix-like systems, and considering this is an inexpensive payment, I think <strong>open_files_limit</strong> should default to a few thousands. Why risk the crash of "too many open files"?</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more-->No setting will ever be perfect for everyone, I know. But there are those parameters which you automatically set values for when you do a new install. These should be at focus and their defaults change.</p>
