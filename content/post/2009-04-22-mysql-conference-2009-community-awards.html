<p>OK. That was a surprise!</p>
<p>In retrospective, there have been some hints along the way. But I don't get hints. I'm the kind of man who, when watching a complicated movie, needs his girlfriend to explain him what goes on.</p>
<p>I was utterly astonished and honored to find my name on the screen, and have me being one of three people called to accept the MySQL Community Award for 2009.</p>
<p>Let me tell you: it is <em>heavy</em>! And it doesn't fit in my bag, either, so I hang around carrying this big heavy box in both hands...</p>
<p>I guess this calls for a short Oscar speech, a written one.</p>
<p><!--more-->My friends and neighbors have heard me say the word "community" quite a lot lately. I was mentioning to them how wild it is. I've been working with open source for some 10 years, and have been using MySQL in particular for 9 years now. The open source model always impressed me with its elegance and honesty. Back when I only started using MySQL, I used to play with the thought I should sometime contribute back.</p>
<p>OK, so it took 8 years to get me moving. Hey, that's quick for me! I have lamps I need to install in our living room, and it's been almost a year since I bought them!</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago I started doing MySQL consulting. A few months later, when MySQL first started their trainings in Israel, I became an official MySQL instructor. I then started working on some open source projects I've been thinking about, getting more and more ideas through my consulting and training work.</p>
<p>At about 6 months ago, I started actively blogging about MySQL. I usually blog about technical issues, many of which come up from my daily experience. I express opinions, some of which may change over time; I sometimes write "mini tutorials" or so, etc.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago I released the openark kit, an open source set of utilities for MySQL. It's still being developed, and interesting (I think) new stuff is coming up.</p>
<p>It's funny, because so many things are being done from my home, in a small village up north. But then again, it's a small world. That's what's so wild about the community. It is powerful, large, fast moving and fast responding. It's as if everyone is gathered in one small room.</p>
<p>Thank you, MySQL, for this honor, and, of course, thank you, the MySQL and open source community!</p>
<p>OK, everyone, wipe your tears, the movie has ended. Today is a very interesting day at the conference, and cakes are now being served! <strong>[IMPORTANT UPDATE]</strong> Ice creams, not cakes!</p>
