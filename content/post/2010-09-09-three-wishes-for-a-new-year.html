<p>It's a new year by Jewish calendar (and, incidently, today is the first day of the next 365 days). And what do I wish for in the following year?</p>
<ol>
<li>World peace</li>
<li>Good health to all</li>
<li>Support for <strong>ORDER BY</strong> &amp; <strong>LIMIT</strong> in MySQL multi-table <strong>UPDATE</strong> and <strong>DELETE</strong> statements, This is sometimes a real show stopper!</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a good year / next 12 months everyone!</p>
