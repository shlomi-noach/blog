					<description><![CDATA[Agree that both Gnome3 and Unity went into wrong direction.
XFCE is great, but I faced some annoying issues using it on two external screens (which is my day to day work environment).

I use Fedora 15 and here is where I found help to keep using Gnome2: http://k3rnel.net/tag/bluebubble/
They have back-ported Gnome2, all you have to do is remove Gnome3 and use their repository.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To my surprise, the volume and brightness keys on my ThinkPad work great w/ XFCE, so some tweaking will probably be required.

There are definitely a few big things missing from XFCE, but they will be there in time. For me, the biggest missing piece is the ability to easily configure multiple/external displays with a gui app. I know for a fact that this is in the works, based off of screenshots from one of the XFCE developers. Keyboard shortcut fixes should be close as well.

I originally ran XFCE on Debian 6, but I couldn&#039;t deal with v4.6. There is a huge difference, especially in usability, between v4.6 and v4.8. Debian backports still doesn&#039;t have v4.8, so I gave up on Stable. As much as I hate it, I ended up going with Ubuntu, due to the rapid release of updates and fixes. I started with Ubuntu&#039;s command line install option, then ran the following to get a nice minimal XFCE installation with X:

apt-get install xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies synaptic wicd-gtk wicd-curses

That right there will get you a nice minimal XFCE system with great wireless support from wicd. If you absolutely must have a graphical login, check out Slim.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jonas,
I&#039;m still having plenty of trouble with keyboard volume keys; keyboard layout switching (xfce keeps forgetting the shortcut key -- long time bug), and other minor issues.

Apple -- when I bought the MacBook Air, there was nothing as light and thin. And I use it a lot on travel, so that&#039;s very cool. Only today to competitors begin to produce laptops in same thinness and lightweightness. I think Acer has a new interesting model.

OS/X: not for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MATE won&#039;t become mainstream, just like Trinity (KDE 3.5 fork) hasn&#039;t.

More support should be put behind XFCE. You even have Linus Torvalds who switched to it as his main desktop environment (first dumping KDE for Gnome 2, then dumping Gnome 3 for XFCE).

I actually like XFCE far more than I ever liked Gnome 2. I always had issues with the Gnome panel, and things just got really bloated. After bootup (with that hog GDM running in the background), my machine was using almost 1.5 gigs of RAM. With my clean XFCE install with wicd uses 256MB RAM after boot.

I predict that XFCE will eventually become stupid and fat like Gnome 2, at which point everyone will switch to LXDE, etc, etc, etc.

As for Apple products, I could never bring myself to spend $2500 on something that I can get in a different brand name for around $1200. Not only that, you are locked into hardware/software/accessory ecosystem with no way out. To top it off, OSX is nothing more than a slightly better version of Unity that costs money. No thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, &quot;password back from suspend&quot; works better for me on Xfce than on Unity (where for 2 seconds I could actually see the desktop before it got protected by password).

I bought a Mac 8 months ago. It took me a month to realize it was great for browsing, music editing etc., but extremely poor for development.
Consider: Unity and Gnome 3 mimic the OS/X desktop. So where does that lead us?
Consider: you open a shell. You try to compile some code. You type &#039;make&#039;. Unknown executable.
To install poor &#039;make&#039; you need to register for Xtools and download 10G (!!!) worth of a bundle.

I eventually installed Linux on my MacBook Air, dual boot with OS/X.
Incidentally, that was *the* *most* *horrible* linux installation process I ever had. Most of that due to the fact Apple goes to great length to actually prevent you from installing other OS on their machines.
Example? You are only allowed to boot an OS from USB if it&#039;s OS/X. You&#039;re not allowed to boot Linux from USB.
A far more astonishing example? You are allowed to boot other OS from CD. But **only** if the drive is Apple&#039;s SuperDrive. Is that crazy or what? You can&#039;t boot a Linux CD on an external Toshiba CD drive you may have...
The external SuperDrive turned to be of poor quality, even in comparison to my older Lenovo laptop&#039;s CD drive. Which made it stall during the installation process. Which meant I made 5 failed attempts of install during which the CD drive simply stopped working midway.

I&#039;m not going to go through the post-install process... A nightmare of its own, and still uncompleted.

But, the machine is so slick...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really need a well integrated desktop environment that works right. For example, it needs to prompt me for a password when resuming from suspend.
