      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_6298&#34; align=&#34;alignleft&#34; width=&#34;240&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.openark.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/common_schema_booth1.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-6298 &#34; alt=&#34;common_schema booth in Percona Live 2013&#34; src=&#34;/blog/blog/assets/common_schema_booth1.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; common_schema booth in Percona Live 2013 (someone left their soup on our table)[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;256&#34;]&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;/blog/blog/assets/38d426af68572303773db7c7db69916b?s=256&amp;amp;d=&amp;amp;r=G&#34; width=&#34;256&#34; height=&#34;256&#34; /&gt; Allen Kinnard[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay! I got a booth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess it was mostly deserted. My hero &lt;strong&gt;Allen Kinnard&lt;/strong&gt;, whom I&#39;ve never met before, was kind enough to volunteer to occupy the booth.&lt;br /&gt;
So between him and me, both of course also looking to visit other booths and talk to people, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/&#34;&gt;common_schema&lt;/a&gt; booth was only moderately attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this was the DotOrg Pavilion: free booths for free &amp;amp; open source projects (e.g. OpenStack, PhpMyAdmin, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
We both did our best to explain &lt;em&gt;common_schema&lt;/em&gt; to the visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The booth was actually titled &lt;strong&gt;&#34;common_schema &amp;amp; openark-kit&#34;&lt;/strong&gt;. However I don&#39;t recall that anyone asked me about &lt;a href=&#34;http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/introduction.html&#34;&gt;openark-kit&lt;/a&gt;. Most were just interested in what &lt;em&gt;common_schema&lt;/em&gt; was. I get that &lt;em&gt;openark-kit&lt;/em&gt; is well known by now to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not have so many visitors, which played well with our occasional absence. But this was a last moment arrangement. In future events I may try to get things on top and have an army of volunteers to help me out (and I hope that by next time common_schema is widely used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.openark.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cookie_monster.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-6300&#34; alt=&#34;cookie_monster&#34; src=&#34;/blog/blog/assets/cookie_monster.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;277&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the criminal department: practically all other DotOrg booths came prepared, with printed material, giveaway stuff and the like. We were like way beyond &#34;the minimalist&#34;. We were &#34;the poor and the pitiful&#34;. So I asked Kortney if she could arrange me some decorations (pulling some strings - yeah!). We were thinking a bowl of candies or something. Eventually she brought a few dozen candies (no bowl) and laid them nicely on the table; very nice touch! Good mixture of colors, nice wave design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? Visitors actually thought they may take one of our candies! Oh, I schooled them.&lt;br /&gt;
But on Wednesday, when we arrived to the booth, a horrid sight stroke us: someone stole (and probably ate) 80% of our candies!&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I hope you&#39;ve got bellyache, and next time you should know there will be surveillance, candy-thief!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
