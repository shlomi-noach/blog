  (Almost) another new year by Jewish calendar. What do I wish for the following year? World peace Good health to all Relaxed GTID constraints I'm still not using GTID, and still see operational issues with working with GTID. As a latest example, our new schema migration solution, gh-ost, allows us to test migrations in production, on replicas. The GTID catch? gh-ost&nbsp;has to write something to the binary log. Thus, it "corrupts" the replica with a bogus GTID entry that will never be met in another server, thus making said replica unsafe to promote.

  <p>
  <p><p>Having attended a talk (as part of the <a href="https://blog.mariadb.org/2015-developers-meeting-amsterdam/">MariaDB Developer Meeting in Amsterdam</a>) about recent developments of <a href="https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-maxscale">MaxScale</a> in executing automated failovers, here are some (late) observations of mine.</p>
<p>I will begin by noting that the project is stated to be pre-production, and so of course none of the below are complaints, but rather food for thought, points for action and otherwise recommendations.</p>
<p>Some functionality of the MaxScale failover is also implemented by <strong><a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">orchestrator</a></strong>, which I author. <em>Orchestrator</em> was built in production environments by and for operational people. In this respect it has gained many insights and had to cope with many real-world cases, special cases &amp; Murphy&rsquo;s law cases. This post compares logic, feature set and capabilities of the two where relevant. To some extent the below will read as &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;ve already implemented this; shame to re-implement the same&rdquo;, and indeed I think that way; but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a code of mine would just be re-implemented by someone else and I&rsquo;ve done the same, myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m describing the solution the way I understood it from the talk. If I&rsquo;m wrong on any account I&rsquo;m happy to be corrected via comments below. <strong>Edit:</strong> <em>please see comment by</em> <a class="url" href="http://www.mariadb.com/" rel="external nofollow">Dipti Joshi</a></p>
<h3>General overview</h3>
<p>The idea is that MaxScale operates as a proxy to your topology. You do not connect to your master directly, but rather through MaxScale. Thus, MaxScale acts as a proxy to your master.</p>
<p>The next phase is that MaxScale would also auto-detect master failure, fix the topology for you, promote a new master, and will have your application unaware of all the complexity and without the app having to change setup/DNS/whatever. Of course some write downtime is implied.</p>
<p>Now for some breakdown.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The detection of a dead master, the check by which a failover is initiated, is based on MaxScale not being able to query the master. This calls for some points for consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically, I would see &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t connect to the master therefore failover&rdquo; as too hysterical, and the basis for a lot of false positives.</li>
<li>However, since in the discussed configuration MaxScale is <em>the only access point</em> to the master, the fact MaxScale cannot connect to the master means the master is inaccessible <em>de-facto</em>.</li>
<li>In light of the above, the decision makes sense - but I still hold that it would make false positives.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m unsure (I <em>think</em> not; can anyone comment?) if MaxScale would make multiple attempts over time and only reach the conclusion after X successive failures. This would reduce the false positives.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m having a growing dislike to a &ldquo;check for 4 successive times then alert/failover&rdquo; Nagios-style behavior. <em>Orchestrator</em> takes a different approach where it recognizes a master&rsquo;s death by not being able to connect to the master <em>as well as</em> being able to connect to 1st tier slaves, check their status and observe that <em>they&rsquo;re unable to connect to the master as well</em>. See <a title="Permanent Link to What makes a MySQL server failure/recovery case?" href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/what-makes-a-mysql-server-failurerecovery-case" rel="bookmark">What makes a MySQL server failure/recovery case?</a>. This approach still calls for further refinement (what if the master is temporarily deadlocked? Is this a failover or not?).</li>
</ul>

  Following up on New features I'd like to see in MySQL 5.8, here are statements I would like to see in MySQL 5.8: ENABLE EVENTS; When promoting a slave to master, I want to be able to enable all those events that are in SLAVESIDE_DISABLED state. Today I script an iteration over the events an constructing the ALTER EVENT...ENABLE statement one by one. Just activate those! SKIP GTID TRANSACTION; I have a transaction on slave that I want to skip, and there's GTID.

  Following up on Morgan Tocker's What would you like to see in MySQL 5.8?, having attended and participated at the brainstorming at Percona Live Amsterdam, and publishing this post while failing to comply with any of Morgan's suggested media, these are the features I would like to see in MySQL 5.8: Dynamicly enable/disable log-bin and log-slave-updates Today, when changing chef/puppet role of a server from a simple slave to an intermediate master and vice versa, a MySQL restart is required.

  <p>
  <p><p>MySQL <strong>5.7</strong> introduces a change in the way we query for global variables and status variables: the <strong>INFORMATION<em>SCHEMA.(GLOBAL|SESSION)</em>(VARIABLES|STATUS)</strong> tables are now deprecated and empty. Instead, we are to use the respective <strong>performance<em>schema.(global|session)</em>(variables|status)</strong> tables.</p>
<p>But the change goes farther than that; there is also a security change. Oracle created a pitfall of <strong>2</strong> changes at the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variables/status moved to a different table</li>
<li>Privileges required on said table</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, my non-root user gets:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; show session variables like &lsquo;tx_isolation&rsquo;;
ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user &lsquo;normal_user&rsquo;@&lsquo;my_host&rsquo; for table &lsquo;session_variables&rsquo;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Who gets affected by this? Nearly <em>everyone and everything</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Nagios will not be able to read status variables</li>
<li>Your ORM will not be able to determine session variables</li>
<li>Your replication user will fail connecting (see <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.nl/2015/08/mysql-578-features-bugs-and-rumors.html">this post by Giuseppe</a>)</li>
<li>And most everyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with the above is that involves two unrelated changes to your setup, which are not entirely simple to coordinate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change your app code to choose the correct schema (information_schema vs. performance_schema)</li>
<li><strong>GRANT</strong> the permissions on your database</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps at this point you still do not consider this to be a problem. You may be thinking: <em>well, let&rsquo;s first prepare by creating the GRANTs, and once that is in place, we can, at our leisure, modify the code</em>.</p>
<p>Not so fast. Can you really that simply create those GRANTs?</p>

  Some personal reflections on PerconaLive 2015: Percona acquires Tokutek Well done! Tokutek develops the TokuDB storage engine for MySQL and TokuMX engine for MongoDB. I will discuss the MySQL aspect only. TokuDB was released as open source in 2013. It has attained a lot of traction and I have used it myself for some time. I met issues with locking or otherwise operational difficulties which I reported, and otherwise was fascinated by such features as great compression, online schema changes, and more.

In the most positive sense. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; this is my understanding of the current status and of the offer. Summarizing the deal: the teams participating with WebScaleSQL would like to push code upstream. Current legal issues limit their options.

  Another new year by Jewish calendar. What do I wish for the following year? World peace Good health to all Multi-core execution for queries After having evaluated a few columnar databases, and having seen how a single query gets 24 cores busy, I can't look at MySQL the same way again. The fact that a single query consumes a single core only doesn't seem right in the year 2014. Shard-query is a cool application-level attempt to solve the above; I would like to see stuff like this implemented inside the server (or inside the storage engine where possible).

  While on the plane back home I wrote down all my impressions from Percona Live 2014. Have lots of TODOs and great ideas to implement. Among all my impressions, there were a few anecdotes worth noting. 5.6 GTID is still unfriendly. It will require complete shutdown &amp; reconfiguration of your entire replication topology; and some companies present hacks around this. Notable, Facebook recoded GTID related code (slave agrees to replicate with GTID even though its master still uses binlog coordinates).

  <p>
  <p><p>I happen to use stored routines with MySQL. In fact, my open source project <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a> heavily utilizes them. DBA-wise, I think they provide with a lot of power (alas, the ANSI:SQL 2003 syntax feels more like COBOL than a sane programming language, which is why I use <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/query_script.html">QueryScript</a> instead).</p>
<p>However I wish to discuss the use of stored routines as integral part of your application code, which I discourage.</p>
<p>The common discussion on whether to user or not use stored routines typically revolves around data transfer (with stored routines you transfer less data since it&rsquo;s being processed on server side), security (with stored routines you can obfuscate/hide internal datasets, and provide with limited and expected API) and performance (with MySQL this is not what you would expect, as routines are interpreted &amp; their queries re-evaluated, as opposed to other RDBMS you may be used to).</p>
<p>But I wish to discuss the use of stored routines from an engineering standpoint. The first couple of points I raise are cultural/behavioural.</p>
<h4>2nd grade citizens</h4>
<p>Your stored routines are not likely to integrate well with your IDE. While your Java/Scala/PHP/Ruby/whatnot code comfortably lies within your home directory, the stored routines live in their own space: a database container. They&rsquo;re not as visible to you as your standard code. Your IDE is unaware of their existence and is unlikely to have the necessary plugin/state of mind to be able to view these.</p>
<p>This leads to difficulty in maintaining the code. People typically resort to using some SQL-oriented GUI tool such as MySQL Workbench, SequelPro or other, commercial tools. But these tools, while make it easy to edit your routine code, do not integrate (well?) with your source control. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve used all GUI tools; but how many of them will have Git/SVN/Mercurial connectors? How many of them will keep local history changes once you edit a routine? I&rsquo;m happy to get introduced to such a tool.</p>
<p>Even with such integration, you&rsquo;re split between two IDEs. And if you&rsquo;re the command line enthusiast, well, you can&rsquo;t just <strong>svn ci -m &ldquo;fixed my stored procedure bug&rdquo;</strong>. Your code is simply not in your trunk directory.</p>
<p>It <em>can</em> be done. You <em>could</em> maintain the entire routine code from within your source tree, and hats off to all those who do it. Most will not. See later on about deployments for more on this.</p>

  <p><p>What exactly is it that a conference committee does? This post comes as response to a comment on <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/12/11/percona-live-2014-conference-sneak-peek/">A sneak peek at the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014</a>, reading:</p>
<blockquote>Why the same committee each year? Community should vote on proposals and committee should just work schedule,etc.</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick the glove and shed some light into the work of the committee. While this specific comment related to the Percona Live conference, I trust that my opinions expressed below apply just as well to any (technical?) professional conference; the point below can equally apply to conferences from Oracle MySQL Connect, O&rsquo;Reilly Velocity to FOSDEM &amp; PyCon.</p>
<p>I can sum up the entire answer with one word: &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo;. For a breakdown, please read through.</p>
<h4>First, what&rsquo;s not feasible with community-based voting, and what looks very wrong</h4>
<p>So why not open up a voting system and let the community do the rating? I always disliked the &ldquo;send an SMS to this number to vote for X&rdquo; approach. It is so unbalanced and unreliable: if I were to submit a proposal describing how my company invented/develops/uses X to do great things, I can expect my co-workers to vote for me. In fact, my company would possibly ask my co-workers to do so. I stand a better chance if I work in a large company; less so in a small company.</p>
<p>Anonymous votes tend to be touched by politics. I could vote for my company, against a competing product, for my friends, against people I dislike, and none the wiser. We can take away anonymity, which means my votes will be public, which means they are visible to all. In which case my ranking will be affected by what people I rate would think of me; which means my rating would not be based on strictly professional/technical grounds.</p>
<p>But before we drop into this endless pit, let&rsquo;s consider: will I, as a KMyPyVelocirails community member, really engage in reviewing over 300 submissions? How many members of my community would take so many hours of their time to do so? Let me clarify, this is a part-time job. It requires time, and it requires a mindset. I&rsquo;m guessing here that you cannot count on everyone rating all talks. Some more prominent talks will be reviewed by more people, others may be left little to not reviewed in the first place.</p>
<p>The idea of a purely community based rating is romantic and beautiful, but not feasible.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the <em>discussion</em>. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the things the committee is engaged in to clarify.</p>
<h4>Duties, responsibility and actions of a conference committee</h4>
<p>The following discussion cannot be an exhaustive description of a committee&rsquo;s work, but it can give a good glimpse into its scope. We begin with the commitment the members take upon themselves: to invest their time and will in the committee&rsquo;s duties. Once you join in, you are expected to work and deliver.</p>

  openark.org blog is now five years old. Hurrah! Throughout these five years I posted almost exclusively MySQL oriented blogs, though I had every intention of writing on various engineering topics. I still see blogging as one of the most important forms of knowledge sharing, and indeed for me the blogs aggregated at Planet MySQL are my main source of MySQL information. I especially like to read technical content straight from the developer; but am also keen on being updated with news on conferences, releases, distributions and some insightful opinions.

  <p><p>Here are a few questions remained open for me from Percona Live 2013 about things that have been said during keynotes; I will appreciate a discussion on comments. Here goes:</p>
<h4>Question #1</h4>
<blockquote><a href="www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/keynote-panel-impact-mysql-56-and-its-future-x">Brian Aker (HP) asks Simone Brunozzi (Amazon)</a> what the underlying technology for DynamoDB is. Simone says can&rsquo;t disclose. Brian says: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s MySQL!!&rdquo;. Simone says: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t disclose&rdquo;. Brian insists: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s MySQL!!&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? I will be very much surprised to learn that DynamoDB uses MySQL; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Why would Brian Aker say that though? Did he just mean to tease Simone or is there something I just don&rsquo;t get?</p>

  <p><p><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">Percona Live 2013</a> is shortly upon us, and it might be a good idea to watch for what&rsquo;s ahead of us.</p>
<h4>Talks of interest</h4>
<p>There is no way I can do justice to all. I wish to point out a <em>small</em> number of sessions I am personally interested in attending. I will not be able to attend them all, since there are too many sessions of interest and too few instances of myself (merely one).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to list some talks which are not absolutely obvious (when Peter Zaitsev speaks of MySQL performance, or Monty speaks about MariaDB, or Robert Hodges or Domas speak about replication &ndash; well &ndash; you&rsquo;re certain to have the ins and outs, right?). I can also expect Galera or Percona XtraDB Cluster talks to attract a lot of attention. There is a lot of good content for each.</p>
<p>But I was happy to find some very special talks this year, which are not the &ldquo;every conference has got to have one talk about this&rdquo; type. Here&rsquo;s a hybrid collection of both types.</p>
<p>After constructing the list I&rsquo;ve intentionally dropped two random sessions. If you are speaking, and not mentioned here, your talk must be one of those two!</p>

  <p><p>This post comes as response to <a href="http://www.codership.com/content/5-tips-migrating-your-mysql-server-galera-cluster">5 Tips for migrating your MySQL server to a Galera Cluster</a> by Henrik Ingo (Galera), which is a good read. This post is a bit lengthy which is one of the reasons why I didn&rsquo;t just comment on said post.</p>
<p>The Galera talk in London was indeed well crowded, judging from my own chair. I think there is an obvious interest in Galera, as well as a general thirst for information from real-life experience. I am personally very interested in production stories; either &ldquo;war stories&rdquo; or &ldquo;peace stories&rdquo; - anything to shed more light on the adoption of this technology.</p>
<p>For disclosure, I have not tried Galera myself as yet. Not on production nor on staging machines. But here&rsquo;s a couple thoughts on Henrik&rsquo;s post:</p>

<p>This is due to Oracle&rsquo;s policy for security-related bugs. Tomas Ulin, Vice President MySQL Development at Oracle , was kind enough to discuss Oracle&rsquo;s policy with me, and these are the key points as I understand them:</p>
<p>Oracle&rsquo;s basic approach is to protect its customers. By publicizing security-bugs, Oracle&rsquo;s customers are vulnerable to black hatters attacks. Therefore Oracle takes measures and privatizes security bugs (crashing bugs can be treated as security bugs since a crash is a form of Denial of Service).</p>
<p>But what of a bug reported in a RC version, as was in my case? There is no strict policy there, according to Ulin. However with a version this close to GA, it is uncertain that a specific bug would be fixed in time. It may happen, then, that a bug would find itself well into GA releases, thereby exposing customers to attacks.</p>
<p>Moreover, GA bugs that are already fixed may remain private, as customers will not necessarily haste to upgrade their working servers for every bug fix.</p>
<h4>My take</h4>
<p>Bug privatization has disadvantages, as well:</p>

  Here's the background: I'm testing many features of MySQL 5.6.7-RC due to two reasons: I'm verifying my common_schema installs and works properly on 5.6 I promised I would present a 45 minute "what's new in MySQL 5.6" seminar in the upcoming OracleWeek (Israel) In the case of common_schema, I have managed to find one weird bug (a behavior regression from 5.5) and one server-crashing bug, by merely running the project's tests, known to pass on 5.1 and 5.5 (and not utilizing any 5.6 features).

  <p><p>MySQL <strong>5.6</strong> offers the groundbreaking online DDL operations for InnoDB. Most common use cases will enjoy this feature, and the need for <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/oak-online-alter-table.html">online alter table</a> scripts will decrease. This is a killer feature!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put this new feature to the usability test. How did it go? Not too well, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>[Updates to this text inline], also see <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/innodb-ddl-kudos-to-quick-responders-on-bugs-mysql-com">this followup</a>.</p>
<h4>sakila &amp; DDL</h4>
<p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/index.html">sakila</a> is still a very useful database. I say &ldquo;still&rdquo; because it is not very large, and computing power is getting stronger; yet on my laptop some operations can still take many seconds to complete, which is just fine for my tests.</p>
<p>Sakila tables are mostly InnoDB, and rental being the largest, I do:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>node1 (sakila) &gt; <strong>alter table sakila.rental engine=InnoDB;</strong>
Query OK, 16044 rows affected (<strong>6.94</strong> sec)
Records: 16044  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So what can be executed during these <strong>6.94</strong> seconds? In a second terminal, I try the following:</p>

  <p><p>After playing a little bit with MySQL <strong>5.6</strong> (RC), and following closely on Giuseppe&rsquo;s <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.co.il/2012/08/mysql-56-replication-gotchas-and-bugs.html">MySQL 5.6 replication gotchas (and bugs)</a>, I was having some thoughts.</p>
<p>These are shared for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I didn&rsquo;t understand it well, and someone could correct me</li>
<li>Or I understood it well, and my input could be of service to the developers</li>
<li>Or it could be of service to the users</li>
</ul>
<h4>InnoDB tables in mysql schema</h4>
<p>The introduction of InnoDB tables in <strong>mysql</strong> makes for crash-safe replication information: the exact replication position (master log file+pos, relay log file+pos etc.) is updated on InnoDB tables; with <strong>innodb_flush_logs_at_trx_commit=1</strong> this means replication status is durable and consistent with server data. This is great news!</p>
<p>However, the introduction of InnoDB tables to the mysql schema also breaks some common usage on installation and setup of MySQL servers. You can&rsquo;t just drop your <strong>ib_data1</strong> file upon dump+restore, since it also contains internal data. Giuseppe outlines the workaround for that.</p>
<p>I was thinking: would it be possible to have a completely different tablespace for MySQL&rsquo;s internal InnoDB tables? That could be a single tablespace file (who cares about file-per-table on a few internal tables). And I&rsquo;m throwing an idea without being intimate with the internals: you know how it is possible to span the shared tablespace across multiple files, as in:</p>

  <p><p>This is a yet-another compilation of the new MySQL <strong>5.6</strong> feature set. It is not a complete drill down. This list reflects what I believe to be the interesting new features user and usability -wise.</p>
<p>For example, I won&rsquo;t be listing InnoDB&rsquo;s split of kernel mutex. I&rsquo;m assuming it can have a great impact on overall performance due to reducing lock contention; but usability-wise, this is very internal.</p>
<p>The complication is an aggregate of the many announcements and other complications published earlier on. See a reference at the end of this post.</p>
<p>Do note I am not using <strong>5.6</strong> as yet; it is in RC, not GA. I am mostly excited just to write down this list.</p>
<h4>InnoDB</h4>
<ul>
<li>Online <strong>ALTER TABLE</strong>: if there is one major new feature in <strong>5.6</strong> you would want to upgrade for, this would be it. Add columns, drop columns, rename columns, add indexes, drop indexes - now online, while your <strong>SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE</strong> and <strong>DELETE</strong> statements are running.</li>
<li>Transportable tablespace files: copy+paste <strong>your_table.ibd</strong> files with <strong>FLUSH TABLE FOR EXPORT</strong> and <strong>ALTER TABLE &hellip; IMPORT TABLESPACE</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>FULLTEXT</strong>: for many, the one thing holding them back from leaving MyISAM behind. Now available in InnoDB with same syntax as with MyISAM.</li>
<li>Memcached API: access InnoDB data via memcahced protocol, and skip the SQL interface.</li>
<li>User defined table location: place your tables in your pre-defined location. Place other tables elsewhere. This is something I&rsquo;ve been asked about for ages.</li>
</ul>

  <p><p>Even without attending the Percona Live conference in Santa Clara, you could tell something big was going on.</p>
<p>One way of measuring it was by looking at the flow of announcements. Here&rsquo;s a brief list, and apologies if I&rsquo;ve missed anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monty Program <a href="http://blog.montyprogram.com/announcing-mariadb-5-3-6/">Announcing MariaDB 5.3.</a> (and later <a href="http://blog.montyprogram.com/announcing-mariadb-5-5-23-ga/">Announcing MariaDB 5.5.23 GA</a>)</li>
<li>Tokutek <a href="http://www.tokutek.com/2012/04/announcing-tokudb-v6-0-less-slave-lag-and-more-compression/">Announcing TokuDB v6.0</a></li>
<li>Twitter <a href="http://blog.jcole.us/2012/04/09/twitter-mysql-published/">releasing its own MySQL fork</a></li>
<li>Oracle announcing so many new features I can&rsquo;t list them all. But they made a <a href="http://sqlhjalp.blogspot.com/2012/04/mysql-565-m8-dmr-table-of-contents.html">TOC</a> for it, and then announced a dozen more, not covered in the TOC.</li>
<li>Continuent <a href="http://continuent-tungsten.blogspot.com/2012/04/continuent-announces-tungsten.html">Announcing Tungsten Enterprise 1.5</a></li>
<li>Zmanda <a href="http://www.zmanda.com/blogs/?p=554">announcing Recovery Manager 3.4</a></li>
<li>And plenty of new partnerships between the major consulting companies</li>
</ul>
<p>All within the first days of the conference.</p>
<h4>What this means, over the surface</h4>
<p>I read a post by someone who was ranting about Oracle making so many announcements just as the conference began. He obviously suspected there was no coincidence. I got the impression he was looking at it the wrong way: as if Oracle&rsquo;s announcements came to discourage the relevance of the conference.</p>
<p>I beg the opposite.</p>

  <p>
  <p><p>I&rsquo;m giving thoughts on the viability of MySQL plugins. This is due to a particular experience I&rsquo;ve had, which is thankfully solved. However, it left some bitter taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>MySQL plugins are a tricky business. To create a plugin, you must compile it against the MySQL version you wish the users to use it with. Theoretically, you should compile it against any existing MySQL version, minors as well (I&rsquo;m not sure whether it may sometimes or most times work across minor versions).</p>
<p>But, most important, you must adapt your plugin to major versions.</p>
<p>Another option for plugin makers, is to actually <em>not</em> recompile it, but rather provide with the source code, and let the end user compile it with her own MySQL version. But here, too, the code must be compatible with whatever changes the new MySQL version may have.</p>
<h4>And if it doesn&rsquo;t compile with the new MySQL version?</h4>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened to me. The particular case at hand was SphinxSE, a plugin which serves as a bridge between MySQL and a <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx Search</a> server. I&rsquo;ve been using it for years and was happy about it. But, as it happened, it took well over a year for sphinx to compile with MySQL <strong>5,5</strong>. This meant I was unable to upgrade my <strong>5.1</strong> installation to <strong>5.5</strong>, a thing I was aiming to do for quite a while.</p>

  <p><p>My <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-command-line-vs-visual-editors">previous post</a> drew some attention, and in particular two comments I wish to relate to. I also wish to make a more fine-grained observation on visual editors.</p>
<p>One comment is by <em><a href="http://www.webyog.com/">Peter Laursen</a></em>, who rejected the generalization in my post, and another by <em>wlad</em>, who was harsher (but to the point), suggesting my post translated to <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it, therefore it sucks&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>I must have delivered the wrong message, since apparently people read my post as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use visual editors, they are bad for you&rdquo;, which is not what I intended to say, nor is it what I actually <em>think</em>. I took a very specific aspect of visual editors and commented on that. My comment should not extrapolate to &ldquo;anything about visual editors is bad&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people should only be using the command line, and am not in the least interested in vi/emacs/eclipse/netbeans kind of wars. Of course everyone should be using whatever works best for them in terms of productivity and ease of use. And of course visual editors have great advantages over command line.</p>

  <p><p>Students in my training classes usually prefer to use some kind of visual editor for MySQL. Typically this would be the software they&rsquo;re using at work. Sometimes they just bring over their laptops with the software installed. Or they would use MySQL Workbench, which is what I usually have pre-installed on their desktops.</p>
<p>I see MySQL Workbench, SQLyog, Toad for MySQL, or several more.</p>
<p>I always humbly suggest they <em>close down their software and open up a command line</em>.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t fancy. It may not even be convenient (especially on Windows, in my opinion). And repeating your last command with a minor modification requires a lot of key stroking. Or you would copy+paste from some text editor. Most students will give it a shot, then go back to their favorite editor.</p>
<p>Well, again and again I reach the same conclusion:</p>
<h4>Visual editors are not as trustworthy as the command line.</h4>
<p>Time and again students show me something on their editor. Behavior seems strange to me. Opening up a console shows a completely different picture.</p>
<p>Things like:</p>

  I will be speaking at August Penguin 2011 (אוגוסט פינגווין), on August 12th in Ramat-Gan, Israel. August Penguin is the annual meeting of Hamakor society: an Israeli society for Free Software and Open-Source Code (read more here). I'll be holding a non-technical talk about MySQL, titled "MySQL and the Open Source Sphere". In this talk I will be presenting my impressions of the nature of open source development of MySQL and surroundings: the core server, the various forks, patches, 3rd party tools, companies involved, etc.

  <p><p>Here&rsquo;s a few thoughts on current status and further possibilities for Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=430801045932">Online Schema Change</a> (OSC) tool. I&rsquo;ve had these thoughts for months now, pondering over improving <a href="../../forge/openark-kit/oak-online-alter-table">oak-online-alter-table</a> but haven&rsquo;t got around to implement them nor even write them down. Better late than never.</p>
<p>The tool has some limitations. Some cannot be lifted, some could. Quoting from the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/mysql-at-facebook/online-schema-change-for-mysql/430801045932">announcement</a> and looking at the code, I add a few comments. I conclude with a general opinion on the tool&rsquo;s abilities.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;The original table must have PK. Otherwise an error is returned.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>This restriction could be lifted: it&rsquo;s enough that the table has a UNIQUE KEY. My original <em>oak-online-alter-table</em> handled that particular case. As far as I see from their code, the Facebook code would work just as well with any unique key.</p>
<p>However, this restriction is of no real interest. As we&rsquo;re mostly interested in InnoDB tables, and since any InnoDB table <em>should have</em> a PRIMARY KEY, we shouldn&rsquo;t care too much.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;No foreign keys should exist. Otherwise an error is returned.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Tricky stuff. With <em>oak-online-alter-table</em>, changes to the original table were immediately reflected in the <em>ghost</em> table. With InnoDB tables, that meant same transaction. And although I never got to update the text and code, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for not using child-side foreign keys (the child-side is the table on which the FK constraint is defined).</p>
<p>The Facebook patch works differently: it captures changes and writes them to a <strong>delta</strong> table,  to be later (asynchronously) analyzed and make for a <em>replay</em> of actions on the <em>ghost</em> table.</p>

  </p>

  Development, Middleware, [Oracle] Database, BI, ERP, CRM, SCM, EPM, SOA &amp; BPM, Java, Security -- all these and more are on the schedule. No MySQL track, not a single MySQL session. Lack of speakers? Hardly. Lack of public interest? I can't imagine. Then what is it? I have no information, and don't want to throw around suggestions. Reading the convention's objectives, I see nothing to suggest why MySQL would not be in.

  <p>
  MySQL@Facebook team have recently published an Online Schema Change code for non blocking ALTER TABLE operations. Thumbs Up! The code is derived from oak-online-alter-table, part of openark-kit, a toolkit I'm authoring. Looking at the documentation I can see many ideas were incorporated as well. And of course many things are different, a lot of work has been put to it by MySQL@Facebook. openark-kit is currently released under the new BSD license, and, as far as I can tell (I'm not a lawyer), Facebook's work has followed the license to the letter.

  <p>
  <p><p>I&rsquo;m evidencing an increase in the planning, confidence &amp; execution for MyISAM to InnoDB migration.</p>
<p>How much can a single consultant observe? I agree Oracle should not go to PR based on my experience. But I find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>More companies are now familiar with InnoDB than there used to.</li>
<li>More companies are interested in migration to InnoDB than there used to.</li>
<li>More companies feel such migration to be safe.</li>
<li>More companies start up with an InnoDB based solution than with a MyISAM based solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the way I see it. No doubt, the Oracle/Sun deal made its impact. The fact that InnoDB is no longer a 3rd party; the fact Oracle invests in InnoDB and no other engine (Falcon is down, no real development on MyISAM); the fact InnoDB is to be the default engine: all these put companies at ease with migration.</p>

  <p>
  <p><p>I would like to get the community&rsquo;s opinion about supporting older (minor) versions of MySQL in open source projects.</p>
<p>If I were to develop some open source project, and a bug report came which only applied to MySQL <strong>5.0.51</strong> (but more recent versions worked fine), would I need to fix the code so as to support this older version?</p>
<p>How about supporting <strong>5.0.22</strong> (released almost 4 years ago, with almost 70 revisions since)? Would you expect an open source project to support this MySQL version because, say, this is the <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/to-not-yum-or-to-not-apt-get">default version in your yum repository</a>?</p>
<p>I would like to concentrate on the currently stable MySQL versions: <strong>5.0</strong> and <strong>5.1</strong>. Versions <strong>4.x</strong> are out of the question for me, and <strong>5.5</strong> is not yet GA.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be great to support <em>everything</em>. But also time and effort consuming. So, I would greatly appreciate <em>your feedback</em>!<br /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to leave formatting, upper/lower-case issues aside, and discuss a small part of the SQL syntax: table aliases. Looking at three different queries, I will describe what I find to be problematic table alias use.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila.html">sakila</a> database, take a look at the following queries:</p>

  <p>
  <p><p>Though most probably I won&rsquo;t be there in person, here&rsquo;s what I expect to hear from <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/speaker/78864">Edward Screven</a>, Oracle, on the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12440">State of the Dolphin</a> keynote, coming MySQL Conference &amp; Expo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m under the assumption that no shocking news are delivered. That is, that for the near future, it&rsquo;s business as usual for MySQL.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s great message, delivered by Karen Padir, was <em>&ldquo;more community&rdquo;</em>. More community participation, more community patches. Looking back, I&rsquo;m not sure I saw that coming true. The 5.4 version was announced at that same conference, and was criticized for being community-oriented yet community-hidden. The latest 5.5 milestones announcement took everyone by surprise again. Ideas from Google patches were incorporated into 5.5M2. but, to the best of my understanding, no community patch was delievered.</p>
<p>I have both <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/in-favour-of-a-milestone-based-release-model">congratulated and expressed my desire</a> that community took greater part in this.</p>
<h4>So what am I looking forward to hear?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Like everyone else, the general plans Oracle holds for MySQL. Again, I&rsquo;m not expecting shocking news here.</li>
<li>The expected roadmap for MySQL, technically speaking. I don&rsquo;t actually know if there is a roadmap right now.</li>
<li>The intended role for the MySQL community. Frankly, it would be just fine with me if Oracle were to say: &ldquo;we will not accept community patches&rdquo;, and that would be the end of it. That&rsquo;s fine, because it&rsquo;s their right, and it would be an honest announcement. Naturally, I&rsquo;ll be much happier to hear &ldquo;we will incorporate the best 20 community patches withing the next three days&rdquo;. Somewhere in between, I&rsquo;ll be really satisfied with a clear explanation of how Oracle sees the community, and how it would like to cooperate with it. Will it share the development plan with the community? Will it allow the community to have a say about what goes in or not?</li>
</ol>

  <p>
  <p><p>I like milestone based release models.</p>
<p>The advantages I find in this model are in particular beneficial for MySQL. What I find good about this model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things are unstable for shorter periods. Even if some feature is not full stable in some milestone, the model encourages that such a feature is fixed on higher priority.</li>
<li>It is easy to create a priority ranking for new features. Moreover, priorities are expressed more by chronological time of development, less by &ldquo;how many people are working on it&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The model pushes towards rapid development, since you can&rsquo;t release M5 before M4 is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last versions of MySQL took long time to complete. Take 5.1, for example: partitioning and event scheduling were long considered GA before row-based replication was half stable. Consider the so small but useful sub-second slow logs; the variables made dynamic in 5.1 (slow log again, for example); the new INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.</p>

  <p><p>This is just something that I realized this morning. There were some talks about how the &ldquo;MySQL Users Conference &amp; Expo&rdquo; was renamed to &ldquo;MySQL Conference &amp; Expo&rdquo; - thereby omitting the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; part. The talk was something like &ldquo;So where are we, the users, in this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve just recalled was a discussion (was it previous year, or the one before that?) comparing the &ldquo;PostgreSQL Conference&rdquo; and the &ldquo;MySQL Users Conference&rdquo;, as it was named back then. In that discussion, the PostgreSQL people were bashing MySQL, saying that the &ldquo;PostgreSQL Conference&rdquo; was all about the database and whatever was around it, whilst the &ldquo;MySQL Users Conference&rdquo; clearly stated that the attendees were &ldquo;just users&rdquo;, not like real participants or members.</p>
