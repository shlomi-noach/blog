  <p><p>In a week&rsquo;s time I&rsquo;ll be speaking at <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/europe-amsterdam-2015/">Percona Live Amsterdam</a>. I will be presenting:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://www.percona.com/live/europe-amsterdam-2015/sessions/managing-and-visualizing-your-replication-topologies-orchestrator">Managing and Visualizing your replication topologies with Orchestrator<br />
</a>23 September 4:20PM<a href="https://www.percona.com/live/europe-amsterdam-2015/sessions/managing-and-visualizing-your-replication-topologies-orchestrator"><br />
</a></blockquote>
<p>This talk will present <strong><a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">orchestrator</a></strong>, on which I&rsquo;ve been working for the last year and a half, originally at <a href="http://www.outbrain.com">Outbrain</a> and now at <a href="https://workingatbooking.com/">Booking.com</a>.</p>
<p>I will show off what <em>orchestrator</em> can do to manage your replication topologies. From visualization, through topology refactoring to automated crash recoveries, <em>orchestrator</em> today plays a key role at Booking.com infrastructure, at scale (oh I love using these words).</p>
<p>You can expect an outrageous demo, a visual walkthrough, some command line examples, and a lot on the logic and mechanisms behind <em>orchestrator</em>. I will present the difficult problems <em>orchestrator</em> covers.</p>
<p><em>orchestrator</em> is free and open source, and is built to be as generic as possible; it is known to be used by multiple well known companies these days, so please join the party.</p>
<p>With that, I conclude with the almighty motto:</p>

  Some personal reflections on PerconaLive 2015: Percona acquires Tokutek Well done! Tokutek develops the TokuDB storage engine for MySQL and TokuMX engine for MongoDB. I will discuss the MySQL aspect only. TokuDB was released as open source in 2013. It has attained a lot of traction and I have used it myself for some time. I met issues with locking or otherwise operational difficulties which I reported, and otherwise was fascinated by such features as great compression, online schema changes, and more.

  <p><p>In two weeks time I will be presenting <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015/sessions/pseudo-gtid-and-easy-replication-management">Pseudo GTID and Easy Replication Topology Management</a> at Percona Live. From the time I submitted the proposal a LOT has been developed, experimented, deployed and used with both <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/refactoring-replication-topology-with-pseudo-gtid">Pseudo GTID</a> and with <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">orchestrator</a>. In my talk I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest that you skip the &ldquo;to GTID or not to GTID&rdquo; question and go for the lightweight Pseudo GTID</li>
<li>Show how Pseudo GTID is used in production to recover from various replication failures and server crashes</li>
<li>Do an outrageous demonstration</li>
<li>Tell you about 50,000 successful experiments and tests done in production</li>
<li>Show off orchestrator and its support for Pseudo GTID, including automated crash analysis and recovery mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will further show how the orchestrator tooling makes for a less restrictive, more performant, less locking, non-intrusive, trusted and lightweight replication topology management solution.</p>

  <p><p>And not for long!</p>
<p>The Call for Papers for <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015">Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo</a>, to be held at Santa Clara in April 2015, is open. The dead line for submissions is <strong>Nov. 16th</strong>; that&rsquo;s just around the corner.</p>
<p>As with previous years, we will hold a <strong>4</strong> day conference, the first being a tutorials day and three days for sessions, BoF and lightning talks, as well as community events. The committee is expecting to review at about 250-300 submissions, out of which it will pick at about 100 talks to schedule or reserve.</p>
<p>We will be using these tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Availability</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Performance Optimization</li>
<li>Replication and Backup</li>
<li>MySQL in the Cloud</li>
<li>MySQL and NoSQL</li>
<li>MySQL Case Studies</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>What’s New in MySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>This year we will roughly pre-define the desired number of sessions we wish to have per track. This is not set in stone and everything is fluid. Yet, this will give us better guidelines at choosing and pursuing content for this conference.</p>
<h4>Submitting a proposal</h4>
<p>We encourage all members of the community to submit their tutorial/session/BoF proposals as soon as possible. Please register/login at the <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2015/">conference home page</a>.</p>
<p>The guidelines for submitting a proposal are generally unchanged; please review past recommendations: <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-get-your-proposal-accepted-to.html">[1],</a> <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/12/19/how-to-write-a-good-mysql-conference-proposal/">[2]</a>, <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-and-expo-2012-a-note-on-proposals">[3], </a><a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-expo-2014-call-for-papers-guidelines">[4]</a>. To add to all these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do note that we are likely to only review a proposal just once. Please submit only after you have finalized your draft.</li>
<li>Make a reasonable length of proposal. We believe 250 - 300 words are quite enough for a good proposal. Please don&rsquo;t write an essay, and remember that you proposal is what gets printed on the schedule, and what is read by the conference attendees when choosing the next talk to go to.</li>
<li>Write a descent Bio.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

  While on the plane back home I wrote down all my impressions from Percona Live 2014. Have lots of TODOs and great ideas to implement. Among all my impressions, there were a few anecdotes worth noting. 5.6 GTID is still unfriendly. It will require complete shutdown &amp; reconfiguration of your entire replication topology; and some companies present hacks around this. Notable, Facebook recoded GTID related code (slave agrees to replicate with GTID even though its master still uses binlog coordinates).

  In less than a month I'll be giving these two talks at Percona Live: common_schema: DBA's framework for MySQL If you are still unfamiliar with common_schema, this will make for a good introduction. I'll give you multiple reasons why you would want to use it, and how it would come to immediate use at your company. I do mean immediate, as in previous common_schema presentations I happened to get feedback emails from attendees within the same or next day letting me know how common_schema solved an insistent problem of theirs or how it exposed an unknown status.

  We've got some spare time on Percona Live during the lightning talks session, and are spontaneously calling for "Hall of Shame" submissions. What is this about? We just had a wonderful Reversim Summit a couple weeks back, where we held the "Hall of Shame" session. We are used to hear talks about success stories and great new technologies. Well, this session is your chance to come up and say: "I messed up, and I'm proud of it!" You will have 3-4 minutes to tell us about how you once accidentally dropped your database; corrupted your data; brought your company's service down.

  <p><p>The <strong>2014</strong> MySQL Community Awards event will take place, as usual, in Santa Clara, April 2014, during the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo (currently scheduled at <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/program/schedule/sessions-day-2">Thursday, April 3rd 2014</a>).</p>
<p>The MySQL Community Awards is a community based initiative. The idea is to publicly recognize contributors to the MySQL ecosystem. The entire process of discussing, voting and awarding is controlled by an independent group of community members, typically based of past winners or their representatives, as well as known contributors.</p>
<p>It is a self-appointed, self-declared, self-making-up-the-rules-as-it-goes committee. It is also very aware of the importance of the community; a no-nonsense, non-political, adhering to tradition, self criticizing committee.</p>
<p>The Call for Nominations is open. We are seeking the community’s assistance in nominating candidates in the following categories:</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2014</h4>
<p>This is a personal award; a winner would a person who has made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This could be via development, advocating, blogging, speaking, supporting, etc. All things go.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2014</h4>
<p>An application, project, product etc. which supports the MySQL ecosystem by either contributing code, complementing its behaviour, supporting its use, etc. This could range from a one man open source project to a large scale social service.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2013</h4>
<p>A company who made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This might be a corporate which released major open source code; one that advocates for MySQL; one that help out community members by&hellip; anything.</p>
<p></p>

  The complete tutorial &amp; session schedule for Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014 is released. This schedule offers both a sense of achievement as well as a sense of regret; for I believe the schedule is very good, and yet some good proposals had to be left out. This is an inevitable result of a conference that is popular and receives far more proposals than can fit within the time frames.

  <p><p>What exactly is it that a conference committee does? This post comes as response to a comment on <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/12/11/percona-live-2014-conference-sneak-peek/">A sneak peek at the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014</a>, reading:</p>
<blockquote>Why the same committee each year? Community should vote on proposals and committee should just work schedule,etc.</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick the glove and shed some light into the work of the committee. While this specific comment related to the Percona Live conference, I trust that my opinions expressed below apply just as well to any (technical?) professional conference; the point below can equally apply to conferences from Oracle MySQL Connect, O&rsquo;Reilly Velocity to FOSDEM &amp; PyCon.</p>
<p>I can sum up the entire answer with one word: &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo;. For a breakdown, please read through.</p>
<h4>First, what&rsquo;s not feasible with community-based voting, and what looks very wrong</h4>
<p>So why not open up a voting system and let the community do the rating? I always disliked the &ldquo;send an SMS to this number to vote for X&rdquo; approach. It is so unbalanced and unreliable: if I were to submit a proposal describing how my company invented/develops/uses X to do great things, I can expect my co-workers to vote for me. In fact, my company would possibly ask my co-workers to do so. I stand a better chance if I work in a large company; less so in a small company.</p>
<p>Anonymous votes tend to be touched by politics. I could vote for my company, against a competing product, for my friends, against people I dislike, and none the wiser. We can take away anonymity, which means my votes will be public, which means they are visible to all. In which case my ranking will be affected by what people I rate would think of me; which means my rating would not be based on strictly professional/technical grounds.</p>
<p>But before we drop into this endless pit, let&rsquo;s consider: will I, as a KMyPyVelocirails community member, really engage in reviewing over 300 submissions? How many members of my community would take so many hours of their time to do so? Let me clarify, this is a part-time job. It requires time, and it requires a mindset. I&rsquo;m guessing here that you cannot count on everyone rating all talks. Some more prominent talks will be reviewed by more people, others may be left little to not reviewed in the first place.</p>
<p>The idea of a purely community based rating is romantic and beautiful, but not feasible.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the <em>discussion</em>. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the things the committee is engaged in to clarify.</p>
<h4>Duties, responsibility and actions of a conference committee</h4>
<p>The following discussion cannot be an exhaustive description of a committee&rsquo;s work, but it can give a good glimpse into its scope. We begin with the commitment the members take upon themselves: to invest their time and will in the committee&rsquo;s duties. Once you join in, you are expected to work and deliver.</p>

  <p><p>Call for papers for <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/">Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014</a> is open. As in previous year, I have the honour of being conference committee chairman, which means I&rsquo;m in particular part of the reviewing committee. I wish to add to <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.co.il/2013/11/call-for-papers-with-lightning-talks.html">Giuseppe&rsquo;s fine observations and suggestions</a>. On submitting a talk, please consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it right the first time (an old advice by Baron). We will not be able to review your proposal more than once. We will not be iterating the proposals again and again to see what&rsquo;s changed, nor will we have a feed for updated content. We will not be able to diff any changes you made to your proposal. Get it right the first time, this is the one time we will read your proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>On <em>rare occasions</em> we may think your proposal is just too important to be thrown just for bad description/grammar/language, and we may contact you to refine.</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposal must be as clear to us as for your target audience. Good proposals are easy to understand. Make it clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being super-famous does not grant you immediate approval. It helps if you&rsquo;ve given the talk <strong>10</strong> times in the past, and we&rsquo;ve all seen it and it was widely acknowledged as one of the best talks ever. But then again, if that&rsquo;s the kind of speaker you are, you probably know how to write a good proposal.</p>
<p>The committee seeks the audience&rsquo;s best interest. We assume the audience&rsquo;s common sense is similar, via extrapolation, to our own. We therefore assume that if we think a proposal is bad, so will the audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re a commercial vendor and you want to make a proposal, that&rsquo;s fine.
<ul>
<li>I suppose the best way would be through the sponsor program</li>
<li>But otherwise we actually accept talks on commercial/closed source solutions. Be advised, however, that the committee members will typically wish to promote open source &amp; free solutions, and so commercial/closed source talks are at some disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are owner/employee of commercial/closed source solution, and you&rsquo;re going to speak on a subject that is related to your product, please be very explicit:
<ul>
<li>either note (in private notes, if you like) that you will be, say, comparing your own product along with other products, and provide full disclosure</li>
<li>or let us know you will in fact <em>not</em> speak about your own product, and make us sigh in relief.</li>
<li>In short, don&rsquo;t let us suspect this is going to be a sales pitch in disguise. It is one of the quickest ways to get your proposal rejected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be interested to learn that last year, a proposal made by an influential and a well known speaker was turned down for that exact reason. Even if he had no intention of doing a sales pitch, that&rsquo;s what it looked like to us, and by extrapolation to the audience.</p>

  <p><p>In one week&rsquo;s time I&rsquo;ll be presenting <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2013/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">common_schema: DBA&rsquo;s framework for MySQL</a> at Percona Live, London.</p>
<p>This talk introduces the rich toolset known as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a>. It is free, open source, extremely useful in solving DBA &amp; developer tasks, and is the next best thing ever invented next to SQL pie charts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Views, with which you can detect and terminate idle transactions, blocking transactions; roll your range partitions; find duplicate keys; block/unblock accounts; get fine grained privileges per account; find AUTO_ICNREMENT free space; &hellip;</li>
<li>Routines: do meta executions such as eval(); get query checksums; duplicating accounts; killing suspicious connections; security auditing; parsing JSON data; &hellip;</li>
<li>QueryScript: if you&rsquo;re not using it, you&rsquo;re missing on a powerful scripting language tightly integrated with SQL/MySQL. We&rsquo;ll see the basic constructs, variables, loops; the more sophisticated MySQL/locks/overhead/danger aware constructs such as foreach &amp; split; throttling, exceptions, it&rsquo;s all in there. I&rsquo;ll present real scripts that saved the day and challenge you to implement them in another scripting language.</li>
<li>Briefly introducing rdebug: stored routine debugger and debugging API</li>
<li>Roadmap (some cool things coming along)</p>

  <p><p>Here are a few questions remained open for me from Percona Live 2013 about things that have been said during keynotes; I will appreciate a discussion on comments. Here goes:</p>
<h4>Question #1</h4>
<blockquote><a href="www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/keynote-panel-impact-mysql-56-and-its-future-x">Brian Aker (HP) asks Simone Brunozzi (Amazon)</a> what the underlying technology for DynamoDB is. Simone says can&rsquo;t disclose. Brian says: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s MySQL!!&rdquo;. Simone says: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t disclose&rdquo;. Brian insists: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s MySQL!!&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? I will be very much surprised to learn that DynamoDB uses MySQL; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Why would Brian Aker say that though? Did he just mean to tease Simone or is there something I just don&rsquo;t get?</p>

I got a booth! I confess it was mostly deserted. My hero Allen Kinnard, whom I've never met before, was kind enough to volunteer to occupy the booth. So between him and me, both of course also looking to visit other booths and talk to people, the common_schema booth was only moderately attended.

  At the airport, trying to sum up my impressions from Percona Live 2013 conference in Santa Clara. Woo! Hard to sum up four excellent days. Shall I review the great talks I've been to? The keynotes? The well organized events? You know what, skip it. There was ONE thing that overshadowed everything. It was the ONE thing for me that was the pure essence of the conference and its greatest joy: Meeting and talking to a great many great people!

  In two weeks time I will be giving these talks at Percona Live: common_schema: DBA's framework for MySQL: an introduction to common_schema, my evolving server side solutions project. This will be a revised version of the talk I gave at Percona Live London; I have felt some weaknesses during that talk, which I've thrown out, letting room for cool stuff. I will discuss common_schema's various views, interesting and useful routines, the power of QueryScript, and a brief intro to the newcomer rdebug, debugger and debugging API for MySQL.

  I'm looking for assistance in manning a DotOrg Pavilion on the upcoming Percona Live conference in Santa Clara. As you may or may not know, free and open source projects are eligible to ask for a free booth on the Expo hall. This is a good chance to promote one's project. Of course, someone must stand behind the counter and answer [technical] questions. I should like to have a booth for common_schema &amp; openark-kit, but am limited in resources -- namely the number of bodies I can occupy simultaneously, just one at this time.

  I had the pleasure of speaking on two excellent podcasts: OurSQL No need for me to introduce this podcast. I just have to say it was only when I interviewed that I realized the amount of work taken for producing one single cast. Kudos to Sheeri &amp; Gerry and Rich Goyette the sound producer and thank you for your kind hospitality! You can find the cast on OurSQL Episode 129: New and Extended, where we speak about the upcoming Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo, 2013.

  <p><p>Apparently <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/sessions-of-interest-in-percona-live-2013">my first attempt at rhyming</a> proved to be unsuccessful: only two courageous men attempted solving the riddle. As I&rsquo;m pretty sure a free pass would appeal to many, and I do have a few readers for my blog, I must conclude my riddle was just too hard. Obscure, perhaps.</p>
<p>Hope I didn&rsquo;t scare anyone off. Without further ado I present some hints. This post will update with more hints as the day progresses &ndash; please refresh to see changes. I start with two hints.</p>
<p>But first, recap of the riddle:</p>
<blockquote><em>Who will open your present,</em></p>
<p><em>Make you play pleasant,</em></p>
<p><em>Tidy your mess,</em></p>
<p><em>Do the same for all else?</em></blockquote>
<p>It has something to do with the MySQL world.</p>

  <p><p><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">Percona Live 2013</a> is shortly upon us, and it might be a good idea to watch for what&rsquo;s ahead of us.</p>
<h4>Talks of interest</h4>
<p>There is no way I can do justice to all. I wish to point out a <em>small</em> number of sessions I am personally interested in attending. I will not be able to attend them all, since there are too many sessions of interest and too few instances of myself (merely one).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to list some talks which are not absolutely obvious (when Peter Zaitsev speaks of MySQL performance, or Monty speaks about MariaDB, or Robert Hodges or Domas speak about replication &ndash; well &ndash; you&rsquo;re certain to have the ins and outs, right?). I can also expect Galera or Percona XtraDB Cluster talks to attract a lot of attention. There is a lot of good content for each.</p>
<p>But I was happy to find some very special talks this year, which are not the &ldquo;every conference has got to have one talk about this&rdquo; type. Here&rsquo;s a hybrid collection of both types.</p>
<p>After constructing the list I&rsquo;ve intentionally dropped two random sessions. If you are speaking, and not mentioned here, your talk must be one of those two!</p>

  I'm happy to report the release of the program schedule for the next Percona Live event, April 2013. While you can see there are still some "TODO"s, and minor scheduling changes still to go, the overall reviewing process is complete, and the schedule is sound. The committee has reviewed over 250 submissions in total, sessions and tutorials. It took two months to review the sessions and finalize the schedule. There were very good submissions, and it wasn't till I started building the schedule that I realized just how many.

  Committee's reviewing process for session proposals for Percona Live 2013 conference is now complete. It is now time for scheduling, checking, double checking, organizing, categorizing and publishing the session schedule. This will take some time. However, we've put together a list of 10 sessions already approved. Now, just building a list of 10 sessions is quite the task: the sessions must be rated high, present a broad range of topics, target audience, speakers...

  I'm happy to be speaking about common_schema at Percona Live London, Dec 4th, 2012. This will be the first chance for me to speak about common_schema, what I believe to be an extremely useful companion to your MySQL server. I will show you how common_schema can leverage your SQL skills and give you new powers. Stuff you had to be SQL-Perl-super-expert to work through is easily attainable with common_schema and QueryScript.

  I'm pleased to announce the availability of the Tutorials Schedule for Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo, 2013. This schedule comes as the outcome of hard work put by the reviewing committee members. Thanks! This work is much appreciated! We got a good number of submissions. We've also reached out to prominent speakers and companies we felt would give great tutorials. All were reviewed, rated, discussed, compared; re-reviewed; some required further feedback from speakers.
  </p>
