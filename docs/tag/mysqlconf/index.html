  <p><p>Even without attending the Percona Live conference in Santa Clara, you could tell something big was going on.</p>
<p>One way of measuring it was by looking at the flow of announcements. Here&rsquo;s a brief list, and apologies if I&rsquo;ve missed anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monty Program <a href="http://blog.montyprogram.com/announcing-mariadb-5-3-6/">Announcing MariaDB 5.3.</a> (and later <a href="http://blog.montyprogram.com/announcing-mariadb-5-5-23-ga/">Announcing MariaDB 5.5.23 GA</a>)</li>
<li>Tokutek <a href="http://www.tokutek.com/2012/04/announcing-tokudb-v6-0-less-slave-lag-and-more-compression/">Announcing TokuDB v6.0</a></li>
<li>Twitter <a href="http://blog.jcole.us/2012/04/09/twitter-mysql-published/">releasing its own MySQL fork</a></li>
<li>Oracle announcing so many new features I can&rsquo;t list them all. But they made a <a href="http://sqlhjalp.blogspot.com/2012/04/mysql-565-m8-dmr-table-of-contents.html">TOC</a> for it, and then announced a dozen more, not covered in the TOC.</li>
<li>Continuent <a href="http://continuent-tungsten.blogspot.com/2012/04/continuent-announces-tungsten.html">Announcing Tungsten Enterprise 1.5</a></li>
<li>Zmanda <a href="http://www.zmanda.com/blogs/?p=554">announcing Recovery Manager 3.4</a></li>
<li>And plenty of new partnerships between the major consulting companies</li>
</ul>
<p>All within the first days of the conference.</p>
<h4>What this means, over the surface</h4>
<p>I read a post by someone who was ranting about Oracle making so many announcements just as the conference began. He obviously suspected there was no coincidence. I got the impression he was looking at it the wrong way: as if Oracle&rsquo;s announcements came to discourage the relevance of the conference.</p>
<p>I beg the opposite.</p>
<p></p>

  Are you attending PerconaLive? Allow me to suggest you attend the Common Schema: a framework for MySQL server administration session on April 12, 14:00 - 14:50 @ Ballroom F. This talk is by none other than Roland Bouman. Roland co-authored parts of common_schema, and is a great speaker. I have a personal interest, of course, being the author of most of the components in common_schema. I would like to convert you to a supporter of this project.

  <p><p>This post complements Henrik&rsquo;s <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2012/february/call-nominations-2012-mysql-community-awards">Call for Nominations for 2012 MySQL Community Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Recap: we keep the tradition of awarding MySQL community members for their notable contributions to the MySQL ecosystem.</p>
<p>Previously, the awards were given by MySQL AB/Sun. Later on they were given by the community itself, as will follow this year, when the awards are presented during the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/">Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo</a> in Santa Clara, this April.</p>
<p>Henrik describes in details the three categories: community contributor, application, corporate contributer -of the year.</p>
<h4>A bit more about the categories</h4>
<p>To add to Henrik&rsquo;s description of the categories, keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Community member</em> would be a person. That person could be working by himself/herself, or can be part of some corporate. It does not matter. What matters is the person&rsquo;s contribution.</li>
<li><em>Application</em>: some code or project which either enhance/complement MySQL (e.g. Replication/HA solution) or uses MySQL. In the latter case, it is important that MySQL role&rsquo;s in the application is significant. For example, some popular site built with some CMS using MySQL may not qualify, if it could run just the same with PostgreSQL or other databases, or if the owners are not actually aware or at all mindful about the specific database technology they are using.</li>
<li><em>Corporate</em>: we&rsquo;re still figuring this one out. The general idea is to acknowledge a corporate which, some way or the other, did a good thing to the MySQL ecosystem or the community.</li>
</ul>

  As a member of the conference committee I review the session and tutorial proposals for the Percona Live MySQL conference in Santa Clara, 2012. The sessions are expected to be technical, and I'm happy the proposals follow this guideline. I use Giuseppe's and Baron's general guidelines for submitting a proposal. I wish to humbly add a couple notes myself. Be fairly brief Explain your session/tutorial as clearly as you can. The reader should be able to get the general impression of the session from two or three paragraphs.

  <p><p>This post concludes my impressions from some of the talks I’ve been to.</p>
<h4>Thursday</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/detail/17189">OQGRAPH: Dealing with Graphs and Hierarchies in Plain SQL</a> / <em>Antony Curtis (Blizzard Entertainment)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I opened this day&rsquo;s sessions with a smile.</p>
<p>Antony Curtis and Arjen Lentz have authored the OQGraph storage engine a while back. I had every intention to try it out, but never got round to it. Which is why I was happy to find this session in the conference. OQGraph is a specialized engine, and comes to solve hierarchal or otherwise graph-related queries, such as: <em>&ldquo;who are the descendants of a given node&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;find a route from a to b&rdquo;</em>, etc. MySQL does not support the <strong>RECURSIVE</strong> syntax as Oracle does, and does not provide out-of-the-box solution for that.</p>
<p>The syntax is just excellent: you just write something like <strong>SELECT * FROM my_graph WHERE from_node = &lsquo;empusa fasciata&rsquo; AND to_node = &lsquo;homo sapiens&rsquo;</strong> to find a route. Otherwise just use <strong>WHERE from_node = &lsquo;Heathrow Central&rsquo;</strong> to find all outgoing links. So this is just plain old SQL, no new syntax involved.</p>
<p>I rounded corners. It is also possible (and required) to specify an algorithm. Do you want Djekstra? BFS? You specify it in the query. The result of a route query is a rowset, where each row is a step in the route, along with its sequence within the route. So you can do your <strong>ORDER BY</strong>, <strong>LIMIT</strong> etc. I find that syntax-wise, <em>OQGraph</em> is very intuitive!</p>

  <p><p>This post continues my impressions from some of the talks I&rsquo;ve been to. I&rsquo;ll dedicate this post to a single session.</p>
<h4>Wednesday</h4>
<ul>
<li>BoF: Replication, Lars Thalmann<em>, </em>Mat Keep<em> (Oracle)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Lars Thallman presented the MySQL 5.5 replication features, as well as the expected 5.6 features. Among other features, one could notice parallel replication, binlog checksums, sub-second resolution and more. There was an open discussion about these features, asking for comments; looking for new ideas and suggestion from the audience.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t possibly cover it all. I&rsquo;ll note two discussion I participated in, and which have interested me. This also serves for noting down to myself my ideas and thoughts.</p>

  <p><p>This post continues my impressions from some of the talks I&rsquo;ve been to.</p>
<h4>Wednesday</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/detail/19732">Replication for Availability &amp; Durability with MySQL and Amazon RDS</a> / <em>Grant McAlister (Amazon.com)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Grant McAlister described the Amazon RDS offer, which provides with a pre-installed MySQL servers, and supports auto management of replication and high availability. He desribed asynchronous vs. synchronous replication, logical (i.e log shipping &amp; replaying) vs. physical replication.</p>
<p>Amazon implement physical replication by shipping data pages to a secondary, standby server, located at a different availability zone. A transaction does not complete before pages are shipped to, and acknowledged by standby machine. The standby machine writes data pages in parallel. This is similar in concept to DRBD. RDS uses InnoDB, which promises data integrity in case of power/network failure.</p>
<p>The fail over process, in case active master has crashed, involves blocking access to the active master, starting MySQL on standby master (promoted to be active), while changing elastic IP for master to point to promoted master. McAlister said this process takes a few minutes. Live demo resulted at about <strong>4</strong> minutes.</p>

  <p>
  <p><p>Having the conference behind now, I&rsquo;m reviewing some of my impressions and of sessions I attended.</p>
<h4>The people</h4>
<p>To begin with, this conference was a big success for me, in many respects. The sessions were great (more on that later), but of course, meeting with new people and with familiar people, was the more important part.</p>
<p>I live in Israel, which makes travel to the US very long and expensive. Apparently not many MySQL community members in my neighborhood, so I don&rsquo;t ever get to meet the faces. The conference makes that possible. I did not participate in all community events, as I had scheduled calls with little girls who miss their father. And I was very much under jet lag. And I have more excuses on demand.</p>
<p>But I did get to meet known faces; people I only knew by name; unfamiliar people who were familiar with my work (fun!); and otherwise just (ex-)strangers.</p>
<h4>The sessions</h4>
<p>There was a variety of sessions to choose from. Many times, I had to pick one out of two or three sessions I was interested in, running at the same time. Not all sessions appeal to one in the same way, but looking back, I find there were a lot of GOOD sessions I attended. I mostly like sessions that are very technical; preferably drilling into details of algorithms &amp; implementation.</p>

  I'm still throwing papers to the trash and starting all over, fixing, rewriting and improving my talk at mysqlconf 2011, where I will be presenting openark-kit: MySQL utilities for everyday use. However I've got something up my sleeve: a benefit many can enjoy, that'll make me a respectful, popular and sought after speaker. While others may try and lure you with such earthly temptations as a 20% off discount, I am in a position to offer you a more spiritual gift: my friendship!

  I'm very pleased and humbled to announce that my submission to the upcoming O'Reilly MySQL Conference, April 2011, has been accepted. I will present a 45 minute session titled openark-kit: MySQL utilities for everyday use. In this session, I will present some of the tools in the openark kit. We'll discuss some limitations of the MySQL server, and how openark kit tools overcome those limitations and provide with solutions to common maintenance and audit problems.

  <p>
  <p><p>Though most probably I won&rsquo;t be there in person, here&rsquo;s what I expect to hear from <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/speaker/78864">Edward Screven</a>, Oracle, on the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/12440">State of the Dolphin</a> keynote, coming MySQL Conference &amp; Expo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m under the assumption that no shocking news are delivered. That is, that for the near future, it&rsquo;s business as usual for MySQL.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s great message, delivered by Karen Padir, was <em>&ldquo;more community&rdquo;</em>. More community participation, more community patches. Looking back, I&rsquo;m not sure I saw that coming true. The 5.4 version was announced at that same conference, and was criticized for being community-oriented yet community-hidden. The latest 5.5 milestones announcement took everyone by surprise again. Ideas from Google patches were incorporated into 5.5M2. but, to the best of my understanding, no community patch was delievered.</p>
<p>I have both <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/in-favour-of-a-milestone-based-release-model">congratulated and expressed my desire</a> that community took greater part in this.</p>
<h4>So what am I looking forward to hear?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Like everyone else, the general plans Oracle holds for MySQL. Again, I&rsquo;m not expecting shocking news here.</li>
<li>The expected roadmap for MySQL, technically speaking. I don&rsquo;t actually know if there is a roadmap right now.</li>
<li>The intended role for the MySQL community. Frankly, it would be just fine with me if Oracle were to say: &ldquo;we will not accept community patches&rdquo;, and that would be the end of it. That&rsquo;s fine, because it&rsquo;s their right, and it would be an honest announcement. Naturally, I&rsquo;ll be much happier to hear &ldquo;we will incorporate the best 20 community patches withing the next three days&rdquo;. Somewhere in between, I&rsquo;ll be really satisfied with a clear explanation of how Oracle sees the community, and how it would like to cooperate with it. Will it share the development plan with the community? Will it allow the community to have a say about what goes in or not?</li>
</ol>

  <p><p>This is just something that I realized this morning. There were some talks about how the &ldquo;MySQL Users Conference &amp; Expo&rdquo; was renamed to &ldquo;MySQL Conference &amp; Expo&rdquo; - thereby omitting the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; part. The talk was something like &ldquo;So where are we, the users, in this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve just recalled was a discussion (was it previous year, or the one before that?) comparing the &ldquo;PostgreSQL Conference&rdquo; and the &ldquo;MySQL Users Conference&rdquo;, as it was named back then. In that discussion, the PostgreSQL people were bashing MySQL, saying that the &ldquo;PostgreSQL Conference&rdquo; was all about the database and whatever was around it, whilst the &ldquo;MySQL Users Conference&rdquo; clearly stated that the attendees were &ldquo;just users&rdquo;, not like real participants or members.</p>

  <p><p>Busy day again: today the Percona conference joined the regular schedule, so more stuff to attend!</p>
<p>What did I attend?</p>
<p>Maria In Depth, Monty Widenius, MontyProgram AB (Percona conference): Monty was discussing Maria performance-wise as opposed to his later session which was feature-wise). He did delve just a little bit into the decision making issues in MySQL and in his new company. He also spoke (and I believe this took the most weight of the session, even if not the most time) of his new company, what he wants to achieve and how.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/6876">Build Your Own MySQL Time Machine</a>, (Sun Microsystems), Mats Kindahl (Sun Microsystems). A web based utility for creating online backups and performing a point in time restoration was presented. The system is based on MySQL 6.0&rsquo;s new backup mechanism, and runs on a slave. The presenters showed how easy it would be to say &ldquo;I would like to restore data to as it was yesterday 14:56pm&rdquo;. Hope to see such final product in the future!</p>

  <p><p>Tuesday: day of the announcements and of numerous sessions. Busy day!</p>
<p>The day started with the <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/8233">State of the Dolphin</a> by Karen Padir (Sun Microsystems). She threw in some announcement, among which were MySQL 5.4, MySQL Cluster 7.0, better release cycles (matching the Enterprise), better code import from the community. Anyway, there is already a lot of talk about that.</p>
<p>Later on, <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/7996">This is Not a Web App: The Evolution of a MySQL Deployment at Google</a>, Mark Callaghan (Google) was a very interesting session, in which Mark described the needs for an enterprise database Google and (mysterious) others had, and the steps taken to modify MySQL in this direction. Mark explained the build &amp; test process they use at Google, teased the MySQL Query Analyzer guys (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s amazing what you can do with sed &amp; awk, actually&rdquo;) - though expressed his appreciation of their work, and mentioned various contributors and collaborators. It was an interesting session, very wide in scope, I think.</p>
<p>The rest of my schedule for the day was:</p>

  <p><p>OK. That was a surprise!</p>
<p>In retrospective, there have been some hints along the way. But I don&rsquo;t get hints. I&rsquo;m the kind of man who, when watching a complicated movie, needs his girlfriend to explain him what goes on.</p>
<p>I was utterly astonished and honored to find my name on the screen, and have me being one of three people called to accept the MySQL Community Award for 2009.</p>
<p>Let me tell you: it is <em>heavy</em>! And it doesn&rsquo;t fit in my bag, either, so I hang around carrying this big heavy box in both hands&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess this calls for a short Oscar speech, a written one.</p>

<p>Monday: day of tutorials. Plenty of interesting tutorials on the Conference itself, plus a session with Mark Callaghan - it was hard to choose. I settled for two tutorials, which turned out to be three.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/5364">Practical MySQL Plugin Development</a>: As a C/C++/Java developer, I am very interested in the plugin API. I have used UDF before, and these turned out to be extremely helpful, and solved me a lot of headache. With the new plugin API I was expecting to learn how to properly write INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables, functions and engines.</p>
<p class="fn">Wasn&rsquo;t it possible to learn all this on the web? Sure, but this presentation was delivered by Roland Bouman and Sergei Golubchik, and I was anxious to hear from their experience. Well, that&rsquo;s what the conference is all about, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p class="fn">The session was very good. Roland &amp; Sergei covered the basics of the Plugin API, the general ideas, then went on to present the specific implementations: daemon plugins, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, FULLTEXT. The session was accompanied by convincing and enlighting examples. For example, a QUERY_CACHE_TABLE: an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table which lists which queries are currently in the query cache, along with the number of used blocks etc.</p>
