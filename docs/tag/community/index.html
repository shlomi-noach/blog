  <p><p>The <strong>2016</strong> MySQL Community Awards event will take place, as usual, in Santa Clara, during the Percona Live Data Performance Conference, April 2016.</p>
<p>The MySQL Community Awards is a community based initiative. The idea is to publicly recognize contributors to the MySQL ecosystem. The entire process of discussing, voting and awarding is controlled by an independent group of community members, typically based of past winners or their representatives, as well as known contributors.</p>
<p>It is a self-appointed, self-declared, self-making-up-the-rules-as-it-goes committee. It is also very aware of the importance of the community; a no-nonsense, non-political, adhering to tradition, self criticizing committee.</p>
<p>The Call for Nominations is open. We are seeking the community’s assistance in nominating candidates in the following categories:<span id="more-7199"></span></p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2016</h4>
<p>This is a personal award; a winner would a person who has made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This could be via development, advocating, blogging, speaking, supporting, etc. All things go.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2016</h4>
<p>An application, project, product etc. which supports the MySQL ecosystem by either contributing code, complementing its behaviour, supporting its use, etc. This could range from a one man open source project to a large scale social service.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2016</h4>
<p>A company who made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This might be a corporate which released major open source code; one that advocates for MySQL; one that help out community members by&hellip; anything.</p>
<p>For a list of previous winners, please see <a href="http://mysqlawards.org/mysql-hall-of-fame/">MySQL Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

  <p>
  Following up on popular "awesome-*" lists (e.g. awesome-python, awesome-golang etc.), I've created the awesome-mysql curated list. This is a list of technologies (and resources) in and around MySQL, and means to serve as a place to find reliable software and info. I recently happened to notice there are some tools I'm familiar with that are unknown to others; tools unknown to me that are in good use. The list is naturally and intentionally incomplete.

  Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Alibaba, MariaDB, Percona team up and offer Oracle all public changes under the Apache CCLA Read again please. My one word summary of this is: Romantic. In the most positive sense. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; this is my understanding of the current status and of the offer. Summarizing the deal: the teams participating with WebScaleSQL would like to push code upstream. Current legal issues limit their options.

  <p><p>The MySQL Community Awards initiative is an effort to acknowledge and thank individuals and corporates for their contributions to the MySQL ecosystem. It is a from-the-community, by-the-community and for-the-community effort. The committee is composed of an independent group of community members of different orientation and opinion, themselves past winners or known contributors to the community.</p>
<p>The 2015 community awards were presented on April 15rd, 2015, during the community event at the Percona Live conference. The winners are:</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2015</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniël van Eeden<br />
</strong>Daniël has done great work on MySQL security and has continued to fantastically support MySQL User Group.NL. He has also logged a lot of bugs (and submitted patches), across all sorts of different MySQL products and has done a great deal to help improve the quality of MySQL.Daniël consistently provides extremely good feedback, on a wide range of features and products, from MySQL server security, through InnoDB, partitioning, and even on other products such MySQL Enterprise Backup and MySQL Enterprise Monitor. His bugs are always reported with a high quality, and many times he even includes a contribution to fix those bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Justin Swanhart<br />
</strong>Justin has worked tirelessly for the past few years on some amazing projects of his own design, Shard-Query and Flexviews. Cross shard aggregation is an extremely complex thing to get right, and Shard-Query takes an interesting approach at this. Flexviews provides a materialized view framework, which is something that MySQL lacks to many people&rsquo;s annoyance. Additionally Justin has also built some performance_schema related tools, reported many MySQL bugs, and has been a public speaker about MySQL in &ldquo;can do&rdquo; style.</li>
<li><strong>Morgan Tocker<br />
</strong>In his day job, Morgan is Community Manager at Oracle. While some of his community interaction has been because of his job, he has gone far and beyond his corporate responsibilities. He is one of the most prolific writers on the MySQL Planet, he has been the most public face of MySQL, and he is always asking for feedback and showing a sincere concern for the Open Source community.For example, Morgan’s community polls on what defaults should be changed in MySQL 5.7 put some of the MySQL product decision making directly into the hands of the community. He is a key player on keeping the community and the MySQL developers at Oracle in touch with each other.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Colin Charles</strong><br />
Colin&rsquo;s list of service to the MySQL Community goes back almost 10 years. He was a community engineer starting in 2005, chaired some of the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL conferences, ran the MySQL projects for Google Summer of Code. As a partner and Chief Evangelist for Monty program, he continues to promote and grow the MySQL ecosystem. Though it&rsquo;s his job, he goes above and beyond, driven by his passion for open source and MySQL.</li>
<li><strong>Frédéric Descamps</strong><br />
Frederic organizes the MySQL &amp; Friends Devroom at FOSDEM every year. He worked towards making a true community driven event participated by all key players. in 2014 the MySQL &amp; Friends devroom also presented a shared booth/stand regrouping Oracle, MariaDB/SkySQL and Percona engineers and developers.</li>
<li><strong>Geoffrey Anderson</strong><br />
Geoffrey is organizor &amp; moderator at DBHangops: a bi-weekly community hangout discussing all things MySQL. The hangouts are free to join, and are streamed live and stored for later playback via YouTube.<br />
Geoffrey works to provide with content, and leads the hangouts with good spirit. DBHangOps makes for a good knowledge sharing media.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2014</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Galera</strong><br />
Galera provides MySQL with synchronous replication, offering a long time sought for High Availability solution for MySQL. It is fast becoming one of the main product/technology everyone is building next-gen businesses around. It is an important part of the renaissance of what&rsquo;s next for the &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Random Query Generator</strong><br />
Random Query Generator has found hundreds of problems with its random generation of queries, because often the most serious bugs are outside of developers&rsquo; expectations and their test cases. Engineers who work on MySQL and its derivatives have been able to vastly improve the quality of the database because of it. Random Query Generator has positively effected every single user in the MySQL ecosystem, mostly without them even knowing it.<br />
RQG was originally created by Philip Stoev, and has attracted further contributors over the years.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2014</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong><br />
Oracle has continued to show its commitment to MySQL with the 5.6 release and work in progress on 5.7. MySQL 5.6 might be the best release ever with significant improvements for InnoDB and replication (performance, GTIDs, parallel apply) including significant changes from the community. The 5.7 release has equally high goals for making replication better (enhanced semi-sync) and making InnoDB faster on big multi-core servers. We also appreciate the continued involvement, excellence and passion of the support and community teams.</li>
<li><strong>BinLogic</strong><br />
BinLogic has been a great steward of the MySQL Community in one of the fastest growing technology hubs, Latin America. BinLogic created the MySQL, NoSQL and Cloud Solutions day in 2012 and repeated the event in 2013, drawing in notable speakers from the community.</li>

  <p>
  <p><p>The <strong>2014</strong> MySQL Community Awards event will take place, as usual, in Santa Clara, April 2014, during the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo (currently scheduled at <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/program/schedule/sessions-day-2">Thursday, April 3rd 2014</a>).</p>
<p>The MySQL Community Awards is a community based initiative. The idea is to publicly recognize contributors to the MySQL ecosystem. The entire process of discussing, voting and awarding is controlled by an independent group of community members, typically based of past winners or their representatives, as well as known contributors.</p>
<p>It is a self-appointed, self-declared, self-making-up-the-rules-as-it-goes committee. It is also very aware of the importance of the community; a no-nonsense, non-political, adhering to tradition, self criticizing committee.</p>
<p>The Call for Nominations is open. We are seeking the community’s assistance in nominating candidates in the following categories:</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2014</h4>
<p>This is a personal award; a winner would a person who has made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This could be via development, advocating, blogging, speaking, supporting, etc. All things go.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2014</h4>
<p>An application, project, product etc. which supports the MySQL ecosystem by either contributing code, complementing its behaviour, supporting its use, etc. This could range from a one man open source project to a large scale social service.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2013</h4>
<p>A company who made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This might be a corporate which released major open source code; one that advocates for MySQL; one that help out community members by&hellip; anything.</p>
<p></p>

  The complete tutorial &amp; session schedule for Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014 is released. This schedule offers both a sense of achievement as well as a sense of regret; for I believe the schedule is very good, and yet some good proposals had to be left out. This is an inevitable result of a conference that is popular and receives far more proposals than can fit within the time frames.

  <p><p>What exactly is it that a conference committee does? This post comes as response to a comment on <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/12/11/percona-live-2014-conference-sneak-peek/">A sneak peek at the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2014</a>, reading:</p>
<blockquote>Why the same committee each year? Community should vote on proposals and committee should just work schedule,etc.</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick the glove and shed some light into the work of the committee. While this specific comment related to the Percona Live conference, I trust that my opinions expressed below apply just as well to any (technical?) professional conference; the point below can equally apply to conferences from Oracle MySQL Connect, O&rsquo;Reilly Velocity to FOSDEM &amp; PyCon.</p>
<p>I can sum up the entire answer with one word: &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo;. For a breakdown, please read through.</p>
<h4>First, what&rsquo;s not feasible with community-based voting, and what looks very wrong</h4>
<p>So why not open up a voting system and let the community do the rating? I always disliked the &ldquo;send an SMS to this number to vote for X&rdquo; approach. It is so unbalanced and unreliable: if I were to submit a proposal describing how my company invented/develops/uses X to do great things, I can expect my co-workers to vote for me. In fact, my company would possibly ask my co-workers to do so. I stand a better chance if I work in a large company; less so in a small company.</p>
<p>Anonymous votes tend to be touched by politics. I could vote for my company, against a competing product, for my friends, against people I dislike, and none the wiser. We can take away anonymity, which means my votes will be public, which means they are visible to all. In which case my ranking will be affected by what people I rate would think of me; which means my rating would not be based on strictly professional/technical grounds.</p>
<p>But before we drop into this endless pit, let&rsquo;s consider: will I, as a KMyPyVelocirails community member, really engage in reviewing over 300 submissions? How many members of my community would take so many hours of their time to do so? Let me clarify, this is a part-time job. It requires time, and it requires a mindset. I&rsquo;m guessing here that you cannot count on everyone rating all talks. Some more prominent talks will be reviewed by more people, others may be left little to not reviewed in the first place.</p>
<p>The idea of a purely community based rating is romantic and beautiful, but not feasible.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the <em>discussion</em>. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the things the committee is engaged in to clarify.</p>
<h4>Duties, responsibility and actions of a conference committee</h4>
<p>The following discussion cannot be an exhaustive description of a committee&rsquo;s work, but it can give a good glimpse into its scope. We begin with the commitment the members take upon themselves: to invest their time and will in the committee&rsquo;s duties. Once you join in, you are expected to work and deliver.</p>

  <p><p>I&rsquo;m happy with <strong><a href="https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a></strong>; it is in fact a tool I use myself on an almost daily basis. I&rsquo;m also happy to see that it gains traction; which is why I&rsquo;m exposing a little bit of my thoughts on general future development. I&rsquo;d love to get feedback.</p>
<h4>Supported versions</h4>
<p>At this moment, <em>common_schema</em> supports MySQL &gt;= <strong>5.1</strong>, all variants. This includes <strong>5.5</strong>, <strong>5.6</strong>, MySQL, Percona Server &amp; MariaDB.</p>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> is today past end of line, and I&rsquo;m really missing the <strong>SIGNAL</strong>/<strong>RESIGNAL</strong> syntax that I would like to use; I can do in the meanwhile with version-specific code such as <strong>/*!50500 &hellip; */</strong>. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m wondering whether I will eventually have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support different branches of <em>common_schema</em> (one that supports <strong>5.1</strong>, one that supports &gt;= <strong>5.5</strong>)</li>
<li>Stop support for <strong>5.1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course community-wise, the former is preferred; but I have limited resources, so I would like to make a quick poll here:</p>
<p>[poll id=&ldquo;3&rdquo;]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the poll&rsquo;s results as a <em>vague idea of what people use and want</em>. Or please use comments below to sound your voice!</p>
<h4>rdebug</h4>
<p>This was a crazy jump at providing a <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/rdebug.html">stored routine debugger and debugging API</a>. From some talk I made I don&rsquo;t see this getting traction. For the time being, I don&rsquo;t see that I will concentrate my efforts on this. Actually it is almost complete. You can step-into, step-out, step-over, set breakpoints, read variables, modify variables &ndash; it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>

  #DBHangOps I had the pleasure of joining into @DBHangOps today, and speak about common_schema and openark-kit. What was meant to be a 15 minute session turned to be 50 -- sorry, people, I don't talk as much at home, but when it comes to my pet projects... I also realized I was missing on a great event: DBHangOps is a hangout where you can chat and discuss MySQL &amp; related technologies with friends and colleagues, with whom you typically only meet at conferences.

  At the airport, trying to sum up my impressions from Percona Live 2013 conference in Santa Clara. Woo! Hard to sum up four excellent days. Shall I review the great talks I've been to? The keynotes? The well organized events? You know what, skip it. There was ONE thing that overshadowed everything. It was the ONE thing for me that was the pure essence of the conference and its greatest joy: Meeting and talking to a great many great people!

  I'm happy to report the release of the program schedule for the next Percona Live event, April 2013. While you can see there are still some "TODO"s, and minor scheduling changes still to go, the overall reviewing process is complete, and the schedule is sound. The committee has reviewed over 250 submissions in total, sessions and tutorials. It took two months to review the sessions and finalize the schedule. There were very good submissions, and it wasn't till I started building the schedule that I realized just how many.

  I'm pleased to announce the availability of the Tutorials Schedule for Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo, 2013. This schedule comes as the outcome of hard work put by the reviewing committee members. Thanks! This work is much appreciated! We got a good number of submissions. We've also reached out to prominent speakers and companies we felt would give great tutorials. All were reviewed, rated, discussed, compared; re-reviewed; some required further feedback from speakers.

  <p><p>This post complements Henrik&rsquo;s <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2012/february/call-nominations-2012-mysql-community-awards">Call for Nominations for 2012 MySQL Community Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Recap: we keep the tradition of awarding MySQL community members for their notable contributions to the MySQL ecosystem.</p>
<p>Previously, the awards were given by MySQL AB/Sun. Later on they were given by the community itself, as will follow this year, when the awards are presented during the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/">Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo</a> in Santa Clara, this April.</p>
<p>Henrik describes in details the three categories: community contributor, application, corporate contributer -of the year.</p>
<h4>A bit more about the categories</h4>
<p>To add to Henrik&rsquo;s description of the categories, keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Community member</em> would be a person. That person could be working by himself/herself, or can be part of some corporate. It does not matter. What matters is the person&rsquo;s contribution.</li>
<li><em>Application</em>: some code or project which either enhance/complement MySQL (e.g. Replication/HA solution) or uses MySQL. In the latter case, it is important that MySQL role&rsquo;s in the application is significant. For example, some popular site built with some CMS using MySQL may not qualify, if it could run just the same with PostgreSQL or other databases, or if the owners are not actually aware or at all mindful about the specific database technology they are using.</li>
<li><em>Corporate</em>: we&rsquo;re still figuring this one out. The general idea is to acknowledge a corporate which, some way or the other, did a good thing to the MySQL ecosystem or the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>Technologist of the Year Award is given for individuals for their technical achievements with regard to Oracle products.</p>
<p>As opposed to <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-conference-2009-community-awards">community</a> based <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/oracle-ace">awards</a>, to win this award one must be <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/awards/technologist/index.html">nominated</a> by himself or his company. There are several award categories: Developer, DBA, IT Manager etc., and many nominations per category. I have been nominated by my company and am happy to have won the award in the Developer category.</p>
<p>Allow me to take the pleasant opportunity to make some acknowledgements.</p>

  I am honored to have been nominated for, and to have received the Oracle ACE award. Nomination for this award is made by Oracle community members, and in this case those being Oracle employees Keith Larson and Dave Stokes. The award is given by Oracle for my involvement in the Oracle/MySQL community and for my contributions. While open source involvement is generally done in the mere purpose of sharing knowledge and solutions, recognition plays a role in it.

  <p><p>What&rsquo;s all this about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/slides-from-my-talk-programmatic-queries-things-you-can-code-with-sql">been to my talk</a> in London, then you&rsquo;ve already got this as homework. If not, allow me to fill in the details:</p>
<p>I was speaking about MySQL&rsquo;s programmatic nature in many aspects (best if you read the slides!). We discussed user defined variables, derived tables, ordering constructs, order of evaluation, time suspension and time calculation.</p>
<p>An issue I presented was that of a very long running query. Say it runs for <strong>20</strong> minutes. It kills your I/O. Do you <strong>KILL</strong> the query or wait? It <em>could</em> terminate in <strong>5</strong> seconds from now, and if you kill it now, you lose everything. But it may yet run for <strong>3</strong> more hours!</p>
<p>We discussed a futuristic feature where the query would gracefully terminate after some designated time. However, futuristic wishes do not help us.</p>
<h4>A self throttling query</h4>
<p>I suggested the idea for a self throttling query. We know how to throttle writing queries, such as <strong>DELETE</strong> queries: we break them into small chunks, then work each chunk at a time, setting ourselves to sleep in between chunks. This is how <strong>&ndash;sleep</strong> and <strong>&ndash;sleep-ratio</strong> work in <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/oak-chunk-update.html">oak-chunk-update</a>. It is how <strong>&ndash;sleep</strong> and<strong> &ndash;sleep-coef</strong> work in <a href="http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/pt-archiver.html">pt-archiver</a>.</p>
<p>But can the same be done for <strong>SELECT</strong> queries?</p>
